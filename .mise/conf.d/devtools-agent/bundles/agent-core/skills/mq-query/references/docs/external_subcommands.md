# External Subcommands

You can extend `mq` with custom subcommands by placing executable files starting with `mq-` in `~/.local/bin/` or anywhere in your `PATH`.

## Command Resolution

When you run `mq <subcommand>`, mq searches for an executable named `mq-<subcommand>` in the following order:

1. `~/.local/bin/` directory
2. Directories in `PATH`

The first match found is used.

## Listing Available Subcommands

Use the `--list` flag to see all available subcommands:

```sh
mq --list
```

This makes it easy to add your own tools and workflows to `mq` without modifying the core binary.
