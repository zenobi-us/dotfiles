# ISO/CD 24495-4 - Plain Language (Organisational Implementation) [PROVISIONAL DRAFT]

> **Provisional status:** ISO 24495-4 is a Committee Draft (ISO/CD 24495-4) and is not yet published; its text is not public. This skill is original guidance based on the draft's public scope. It does not reproduce ISO text and its output is never a compliance statement. Expect revision when the standard is published.

Turns the agent from a copy editor into an implementation consultant. It assesses an organisation's *capacity to produce* plain language across governance, capability, process, measurement, and culture, rather than the quality of any single text.

## Scope & Execution Boundaries

1. **Activation Rules:**
   - **Activate for:** plain language gap analysis, maturity assessment, policy or style guide drafting, review workflow design, training planning, readiness for the future published standard.
   - **Never activate for:** writing, rewriting, summarising, or reviewing an individual document. Those tasks belong to `iso-24495-1`, `-2`, `-3`, and `-5`.

2. **Confirmation Before Sweeps:**
   - Both audit scripts read many files. State which directory will be swept and get the user's confirmation before running either.

3. **Evidence Primacy:**
   - Never assert a maturity level without evidence: a found artefact, a confirmed answer, or a measured count. Absent evidence scores as absent.

## The Audit Workflow

Run the four steps in order. Each feeds the next.

1. **Sweep for process artefacts (primary):**
   - Run `bun scripts/audit-evidence-cli.ts <workspace-dir> --json evidence.json`.
   - This detects the *system*: policy, review workflow, automated checks, training, glossary. It reads presence only; you evaluate the quality of what it finds.
2. **Audit the document corpus (secondary):**
   - Run `bun scripts/audit-corpus-cli.ts <corpus-dir> --json findings.json`.
   - Output feeds the **Measurement dimension only**, as evidence of what the system produces. Text quality alone never raises a maturity level: excellent text can come from one unsupported expert, and flawed text can coexist with a strong process that is catching it.
3. **Interview the human (3 to 5 questions maximum):**
   - Use `references/interview-guide.md`. Ask only what the file system cannot show (leadership, culture, training delivery). Record answers in the `answers.json` structure and cite evidence for each `true`.
   - Score with `bun scripts/score-maturity-cli.ts answers.json --json maturity.json`. Scoring is deterministic so levels cannot drift between sessions.
4. **Generate the gap report:**
   - Run `bun scripts/generate-report-cli.ts findings.json evidence.json maturity.json --state <dir>/state.json --out gap-report.md`.
   - State is append-only; successive audits produce a trend table that proves or disproves progress. Store `state.json` in the organisation's repository, not in the skill directory (installed skills may be read-only).

## Quantitative Rules & Hard Constraints

1. **Proxies, Not Compliance:** Corpus metrics (sentence length, paragraph length, legalese, heading depth) are mechanical proxies. Never present them, or this report, as ISO compliance or certification.
2. **Interview Cap:** Ask the human at most 5 questions per audit. Infer everything else from artefacts.
3. **Ranked Actions:** Every gap in the report gets a recommended action, ranked by reader impact against effort, tied to the criterion it unblocks.
4. **Language Boundary:** The text heuristics are English-centric. For non-English corpora, skip step 2 and say so in the report.

## Contrastive Examples

### Example 1: Reporting a Gap
* ❌ **Not aligned (Vague, Unevidenced):**
  > "The organisation's culture around plain language seems weak and should be improved."
* ✅ **ISO/CD 24495-4 (Draft) Aligned:**
  > **Culture: Level 1.** Leadership is aware of the policy, confirmed in interview, but does not champion it. No leader has communicated it in the last year, and no feedback loop exists. **Action (unblocks `leadership-champions`):** the policy owner asks one executive sponsor to open the next all-hands with a plain language example.

## Pre-Output Self-Audit Checklist

Before delivering a gap report, audit against these checks:
- [ ] **Correct activation:** Was this an implementation task, not a writing task?
- [ ] **Sweep confirmed:** Did the user approve each directory sweep?
- [ ] **Evidence cited:** Does every maturity level and `true` answer cite an artefact, answer, or count?
- [ ] **Proxies labelled:** Are corpus metrics presented as proxies feeding Measurement only?
- [ ] **State saved:** Was `state.json` updated so the next audit can show a trend?
- [ ] **Provisional stated:** Does the report declare the committee-draft basis and its limitations?
