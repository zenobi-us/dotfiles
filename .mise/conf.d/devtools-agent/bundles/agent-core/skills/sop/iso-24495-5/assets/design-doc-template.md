## 1. Summary

[Summarise the reader need, the proposed design and the expected outcome. Say what the reader must do next. Name any condition that changes the decision, and any qualification a reader must respect, whether legal, financial or an approval.]

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1. What each component is responsible for

[Insert a diagram with a text alternative, or a summary table naming each component and its responsibility.]

### 2.2. How a request flows through the system

[Describe the main request and response flow.]

#### 2.2.1. How a sign-in is checked

[Describe sign-in, token validation, and failure handling.]

## 3. Data Model

### 3.1. Entities and Relationships

[Name the narrowest width each table must survive, then read them back at that width. Where no width is known, use labelled records instead.]

| Entity | Purpose | Relationships |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Entity]** | [Purpose] | [Related entities] |

### 3.2. How data enters, changes and leaves

[Describe how data enters, changes, persists, and leaves the system.]

## 4. API Design

### 4.1. Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose | Request | Response |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `[METHOD]` | `[path]` | [Purpose] | [Request shape] | [Response shape] |

### 4.2. Error Handling

[Define error categories, response shapes, and retry behaviour.]

## 5. Security Model

### 5.1. Threats and Controls

| Threat | Control | Residual risk |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Threat]** | [Control] | [Residual risk] |

### 5.2. Access Control

[Define roles, permissions, and enforcement points.]

## 6. Deployment Plan

### 6.1. Environments

[Describe each environment and its release criteria.]

### 6.2. How the change ships and how it comes back

1. [Prepare and verify the release.]
2. [Deploy the change in controlled stages.]
3. [Check the release against the criteria in 6.1.]

| Check result | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[Criteria met]** | [Finish the release and record it.] |
| **[Criteria not met]** | [Follow the rollback procedure.] |
