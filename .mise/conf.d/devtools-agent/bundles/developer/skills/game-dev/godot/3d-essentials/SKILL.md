# 3D Essentials in Godot 4.3+

All examples target Godot 4.3+ with no deprecated APIs. GDScript is shown first, then C#.

> **Related skills:** **player-controller** for CharacterBody3D movement, **physics-system** for 3D collision shapes and raycasting, **camera-system** for Camera3D follow and transitions, **shader-basics** for spatial shaders and post-processing, **godot-optimization** for 3D performance tuning, **animation-system** for AnimationTree and 3D animation blending.

## 1. 3D Coordinate System & Core Nodes

### Coordinate System

Godot uses a **right-handed** coordinate system with metric units (1 unit = 1 meter):

| Axis | Direction | Color |
|------|-----------|--------|
| X | Right | Red |
| Y | Up | Green |
| Z | Out of screen (+Z toward viewer) | Blue |

> Cameras and lights point along **-Z** by default. When a character "faces forward," they look along -Z.

### Essential 3D Nodes

| Node | Purpose |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `Node3D` | Base transform node — position, rotation, scale |
| `MeshInstance3D` | Displays a mesh with a material |
| `Camera3D` | Required to render 3D — perspective or orthogonal |
| `DirectionalLight3D` | Sun/moon — parallel rays, cheapest light |
| `OmniLight3D` | Point light — emits in all directions |
| `SpotLight3D` | Cone light — flashlights, spotlights |
| `WorldEnvironment` | Sky, fog, tonemap, post-processing |
| `Decal` | Projected texture onto surfaces |
| `GPUParticles3D` | GPU-driven particle effects |
| `CSGBox3D` etc. | Constructive Solid Geometry — prototyping |
| `GridMap` | 3D tile-based level building |

> **Godot 4.7+:** `GridMap` exposes its internal octants for spatial queries (`cell_octant_size`, `get_used_octants()`, `get_octants_in_bounds()` and friends) so you can scope work to a region instead of walking every cell. `CSGShape3D` gains `autosmooth` / `smoothing_angle` for automatic face smoothing.

## 2. Materials

### StandardMaterial3D vs ShaderMaterial

| Material | Use For | Notes |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `StandardMaterial3D` | Most 3D objects — PBR workflow | No code; Inspector-driven |
| `ORMMaterial3D` | Same as Standard but with packed ORM texture | Occlusion+Roughness+Metallic in one texture |
| `ShaderMaterial` | Custom effects — toon, water, dissolve | Requires spatial shader code |

### Key StandardMaterial3D Properties

The PBR core: `albedo_color` / `albedo_texture` (base color), `metallic` (0 dielectric → 1 metal), `roughness` (0 mirror → 1 matte), `normal_map` (surface detail), `ao_texture` (ambient occlusion). Add `emission` + `emission_energy_multiplier` for self-illumination, `heightmap_texture` for parallax, `rim` / `clearcoat` for material flair.

### Transparency Modes

Prefer Alpha Scissor (fast, shadowed cutouts) or Alpha Hash (dithered — hair) over plain Alpha (slow, no shadows); Depth Pre-Pass suits mostly-opaque meshes with transparent edges.

> See [references/materials-and-lighting-recipes.md](references/materials-and-lighting-recipes.md#transparency-modes) for the comparison table.

### Setting Materials from Code & Material Instancing

Create a `StandardMaterial3D` at runtime, assign to `mesh.material_override`, and drive emissive flashes via Tween. Use `.duplicate()` to make per-instance copies so changing one mesh's material doesn't affect others.

> See [references/materials-and-lighting-recipes.md](references/materials-and-lighting-recipes.md) for the full GDScript and C# recipes (basic material setup, emissive flash, per-instance duplicate, dynamic OmniLight3D explosion).

## 3. Lighting

### Light Types Comparison

| Light | Shape | Shadows | Cost | Max Visible |
|---------------------|---------------|---------|---------|----------------------|
| `DirectionalLight3D` | Parallel rays | PSSM | Cheapest | 8 (Forward+) |
| `OmniLight3D` | Sphere | Cube/Dual Paraboloid | Medium | 512 clustered* |
| `SpotLight3D` | Cone | Single texture | Cheap | 512 clustered* |
| `AreaLight3D` (4.7+) | Rectangle | PCSS soft | Most expensive | — |

*Forward+ shares 512 clustered element slots among omni lights, spot lights, decals, and reflection probes.

### Light Properties

Key knobs: `light_color`, `light_energy` (HDR — values >1 are valid), `shadow_enabled` (big perf hit), `directional_shadow_mode`, `directional_shadow_max_distance` (lower = sharper shadows).

> See [references/materials-and-lighting-recipes.md](references/materials-and-lighting-recipes.md#light-properties) for the properties table and the GDScript + C# sun setup snippet.

### AreaLight3D (Godot 4.7+)

`AreaLight3D` emits light from a rectangle along the node's **-Z** — neon tubes, screens, softbox panels — with PCSS soft shadows driven by `light_size`. Key properties: `area_size = Vector2(1, 1)` (meters), `area_range = 5.0`, `area_attenuation = 1.0` (`2.0` = physically accurate inverse square), `area_normalize_energy = true` (resizing keeps total output stable), optional `area_texture` for textured emission (Forward+/Mobile only). Mobile support is limited and Compatibility cannot cast area-light shadows; in Forward+, a single visible area light adds clustered-lighting cost to *all* rendered objects — reserve for cinematics or high-end targets.

> See [references/materials-and-lighting-recipes.md](references/materials-and-lighting-recipes.md#arealight3d-godot-47) for the full property table and the GDScript + C# setup recipe.

### Dynamic Point Light

Spawn an `OmniLight3D` at runtime, drive its energy with a tween, queue-free on completion. Common for explosions, muzzle flashes, magic effects.

> See [references/materials-and-lighting-recipes.md](references/materials-and-lighting-recipes.md#dynamic-point-light) for the full GDScript and C# recipe.

### Shadow Configuration & Bake Modes

Prefer `shadow_normal_bias` over `shadow_bias` against acne; keep `directional_shadow_max_distance` at the minimum needed (50–100 m typical). Bake modes: Disabled (fully real-time, default), Static (fully baked, no runtime cost), Dynamic (indirect baked, direct real-time).

> See [references/materials-and-lighting-recipes.md](references/materials-and-lighting-recipes.md#shadow-configuration-tips) for the shadow-tuning table and the bake-modes table.

---

## 4. Environment & Post-Processing

Configure global rendering — sky background, tonemapping, glow, SSR, SSAO/SSIL/SDFGI, depth-of-field — through a `WorldEnvironment` node holding an `Environment` resource. Pick a tonemap (`Linear`, `Reinhard`, `Filmic`, `ACES`, or `AgX`) on the Environment resource. Forward+ enables SSAO, SSIL, SSR, and SDFGI; mobile/compatibility renderers omit these.

> See [references/environment-and-post.md](references/environment-and-post.md) for the full setup recipes (sky options, tonemap modes, all post-processing effects, the 4.6+ glow-before-tonemapping pipeline change, AgX `tonemap_white` / `tonemap_contrast` controls, and the 4.6+ SSR quality upgrade).

> **Godot 4.7+:** `display/window/hdr/request_hdr_output` (default `false`, promoted to a basic project setting) requests HDR display output for the main window and editor where supported, auto-switching between HDR and SDR as screens or system settings change; it forces `Viewport.use_hdr_2d` on for the main viewport (other `SubViewport`s must enable it themselves). Read only at startup — toggle `Window.hdr_output_requested` at runtime.

> ⚠️ **Changed in Godot 4.7:** The `rendering/reflections/sky_reflections/roughness_layers` default changed from `7` to `8`, altering sky-reflection roughness mip distribution for projects that left it at the default. Set it back to `7` to keep the 4.6 output. See the [4.7 migration guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/migrating/upgrading_to_godot_4.7.html).

## 5. Global Illumination

Five GI options trade quality for cost: none (ambient only) → ReflectionProbe (localized) → LightmapGI (best quality, baked) → VoxelGI (small/medium dynamic) → SDFGI (large open-world). VoxelGI/SDFGI/LightmapGI require Forward+. The 4.5+ subsections below (Specular Occlusion, Bent Normal Maps) stay inline because they apply across GI methods.

> See [references/global-illumination.md](references/global-illumination.md) for the methods comparison table, ReflectionProbe scene + code recipe, LightmapGI bake workflow, and SDFGI configuration.

### Specular Occlusion from Ambient Light (Godot 4.5+)

Godot 4.5+ automatically computes specular occlusion from the ambient light probe when **LightmapGI**, **VoxelGI**, or **SDFGI** is active. Prevents unrealistically bright speculars in areas that receive little indirect light (under eaves, inside crevices, in corners). No API change — re-bake after upgrading to see the improvement on metallic / low-roughness surfaces. ReflectionProbe alone does not provide specular occlusion.

### Bent Normal Maps (Godot 4.5+)

Bent normal maps encode the mean unoccluded direction from each texel — the average direction toward open sky across the hemisphere. When assigned to the **Bent Normal** slot on `StandardMaterial3D`, Godot uses this information to improve indirect lighting directionality and specular occlusion accuracy. The result is more realistic ambient lighting on complex surfaces like cloth, carved stone, or organic shapes.

**Inspector setup:** In `StandardMaterial3D`, enable **Bent Normal** → assign your tangent-space bent normal texture (baked from Marmoset, Substance, or xNormal).

> **Most visible on:** materials that combine low roughness or high metallic values with baked GI (LightmapGI / VoxelGI / SDFGI). On fully rough dielectric surfaces the benefit is subtler. Use on hero assets; skip on background geometry.

> See [references/materials-and-lighting-recipes.md](references/materials-and-lighting-recipes.md) for the runtime-assignment GDScript + C# code path (the Inspector setup above is the typical case).

---

## 6. Fog

Three layers: depth/height fog set on `WorldEnvironment.environment` (cheap, all renderers), volumetric fog (Forward+ only — godrays through depth), and `FogVolume` nodes for localized fog effects (interior rooms, pits, atmospheric volumes).

> See [references/fog-recipes.md](references/fog-recipes.md) for the full GDScript and C# recipes — depth/height fog setup, volumetric fog parameters and performance notes, and FogVolume placement.

> ⚠️ **Changed in Godot 4.7:** Volumetric fog is now blended using transmittance instead of opacity, so existing volumetric fog can look different after upgrading. Enable the project setting `rendering/environment/fog/use_legacy_blending` (default `false`) to restore the previous behavior. See [GH-119414](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/119414).

## 7. Decals

`Decal` nodes project a texture onto whatever surfaces fall within their bounding box — bullet holes, blood splatter, ground details, signage. All renderers support decals; performance scales with overdraw and decal count.

> See [references/decals.md](references/decals.md) for the scene setup, runtime spawning recipe (GDScript + C#), and the per-renderer decal limits.

---

## 8. Optimization — LOD, Culling, MultiMesh

Four tools: automatic mesh LOD (set on import or per `MeshInstance3D`), manual `VisibilityRange` for staged swaps, occlusion culling via `OccluderInstance3D`, and `MultiMeshInstance3D` for thousands of identical meshes in one draw call.

> See [references/lod-and-culling.md](references/lod-and-culling.md) for setup recipes for each tool plus the MultiMesh runtime population example.

## 9. Renderer Comparison

Pick the renderer before you build the look: **Forward+** (desktop default) is the only one with SDFGI and volumetric fog, **Mobile** trades those for performance on tile-based GPUs, and **Compatibility** (GLES3-class) drops most advanced lighting entirely. Advice that assumes SDFGI silently fails on the other two.

## 10. Common Pitfalls

Quick symptom → cause → fix table covering black scenes, dark objects without ambient light, shadow acne and peter-panning, popping shadows, flat materials, invisible decals, transparency sorting artifacts, SDFGI light leaking, missing volumetric fog, and invisible MultiMesh instances.
