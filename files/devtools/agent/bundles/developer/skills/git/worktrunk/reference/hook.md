# wt hook

Run configured hooks.

Hooks are shell commands that run at key points in the worktree lifecycle — automatically during `wt switch`, `wt merge`, & `wt remove`, or on demand via `wt hook <type>`. Both user and project hooks are supported.

# Hook Types

| Event | `pre-` — blocking | `post-` — background |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **switch** | `pre-switch` | `post-switch` |
| **start** | `pre-start` | `post-start` |
| **commit** | `pre-commit` | `post-commit` |
| **merge** | `pre-merge` | `post-merge` |
| **remove** | `pre-remove` | `post-remove` |

`pre-*` hooks block — failure aborts the operation. `post-*` hooks run in the background with output logged (use [`wt config state logs`](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#wt-config-state-logs) to find and manage log files). Use `-v` to see expanded command details for background hooks.

The most common starting point is `post-start` — it runs background tasks (dev servers, file copying, builds) without blocking worktree creation. Prefer `post-start` over `pre-start` unless a later step needs the work completed first.

| Hook | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `pre-switch` | Runs before branch resolution or worktree creation. `{{ branch }}` is the destination as typed (before resolution) |
| `post-switch` | Triggers on all switch results: creating, switching to existing, or staying on current |
| `pre-start` | Runs once when a new worktree is created, blocking `post-start`/`--execute` until complete: dependency install, env file generation |
| `post-start` | Runs once when a new worktree is created, in the background: dev servers, long builds, file watchers, copying caches |
| `pre-commit` | Formatters, linters, type checking — runs during `wt merge` before the squash commit |
| `post-commit` | CI triggers, notifications, background linting |
| `pre-merge` | Tests, security scans, build verification — runs after rebase, before merge to target |
| `post-merge` | Deployment, notifications, installing updated binaries. Runs in the target branch worktree if it exists, otherwise the primary worktree |
| `pre-remove` | Cleanup before worktree deletion: saving test artifacts, backing up state. Runs in the worktree being removed |
| `post-remove` | Stopping dev servers, removing containers, notifying external systems. Template variables reference the removed worktree |

During `wt merge`, hooks run in this order: pre-commit → post-commit → pre-merge → pre-remove → post-remove + post-merge. As usual, post-* hooks run in the background. See [`wt merge`](https://worktrunk.dev/merge/#pipeline) for the complete pipeline.

# Security

Project commands require approval on first run:

```
▲ repo needs approval to execute 3 commands:

○ pre-start install:
   npm ci
○ pre-start build:
   cargo build --release
○ pre-start env:
   echo 'PORT={{ branch | hash_port }}' > .env.local

❯ Allow and remember? [y/N]
```

- Approvals are saved to `~/.config/worktrunk/approvals.toml`
- If a command changes, new approval is required
- Use `--yes` to bypass prompts — useful for CI and automation
- Use `--no-hooks` to skip hooks

Manage approvals with `wt config approvals add` and `wt config approvals clear`.

# Configuration

Hooks can be defined in project config (`.config/wt.toml`) or user config (`~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml`). Both use the same format.

## Hook forms

Hooks take one of three forms, determined by their TOML shape.

A string is a single command:

```toml
pre-start = "npm install"
```

A table is multiple commands that run concurrently:

```toml
[post-start]
server = "npm run dev"
watch = "npm run watch"
```

A pipeline is a sequence of `[[hook]]` blocks run in order. Each block is one step; multiple keys within a block run concurrently. A failing step aborts the rest of the pipeline:

```toml
[[post-start]]
install = "npm ci"

[[post-start]]
build = "npm run build"
server = "npm run dev"
```

Here `install` runs first, then `build` and `server` run together.

Most hooks don't need `[[hook]]` blocks. Reach for them when there's a dependency chain — typically setup that must complete before later steps, like installing dependencies before running a build and dev server concurrently.

Table form for pre-* hooks is deprecated and its behavior will change in a future version — use `[[hook]]` blocks instead.

## Project vs user hooks

| Aspect | Project hooks | User hooks |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| Location | `.config/wt.toml` | `~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml` |
| Scope | Single repository | All repositories (or [per-project](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#user-project-specific-settings)) |
| Approval | Required | Not required |
| Execution order | After user hooks | First |

Skip all hooks with `--no-hooks`. To run a specific hook when user and project both define the same name, use `user:name` or `project:name` syntax.

## Template variables

Hooks can use template variables that expand at runtime:

| Kind | Variable | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| active    | `{{ branch }}`                | Branch name |
|           | `{{ worktree_path }}`         | Worktree path |
|           | `{{ worktree_name }}`         | Worktree directory name |
|           | `{{ commit }}`                | Branch HEAD SHA |
|           | `{{ short_commit }}`          | Branch HEAD SHA, abbreviated per `core.abbrev` |
|           | `{{ upstream }}`              | Branch upstream (if tracking a remote) |
| operation | `{{ base }}`                  | Base branch name |
|           | `{{ base_worktree_path }}`    | Base worktree path |
|           | `{{ target }}`                | Target branch name |
|           | `{{ target_worktree_path }}`  | Target worktree path |
|           | `{{ pr_number }}`             | PR/MR number (when creating via `pr:N` / `mr:N`) |
|           | `{{ pr_url }}`                | PR/MR web URL (when creating via `pr:N` / `mr:N`) |
| repo      | `{{ repo }}`                  | Repository directory name |
|           | `{{ repo_path }}`             | Absolute path to repository root |
|           | `{{ owner }}`                 | Primary remote owner path (may include subgroups) |
|           | `{{ primary_worktree_path }}` | Primary worktree path |
|           | `{{ default_branch }}`        | Default branch name |
|           | `{{ remote }}`                | Primary remote name |
|           | `{{ remote_url }}`            | Remote URL |
| exec      | `{{ cwd }}`                   | Directory where the hook command runs |
|           | `{{ hook_type }}`             | Hook type being run (e.g. `pre-start`, `pre-merge`) |
|           | `{{ hook_name }}`             | Hook command name (if named) |
|           | `{{ args }}`                  | Tokens forwarded from the CLI — see [Running Hooks Manually](#running-hooks-manually) |
| user      | `{{ vars.<key> }}`            | Per-branch variables from [`wt config state vars`](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#wt-config-state-vars) |

Bare variables (`branch`, `worktree_path`, `commit`) refer to the branch the operation acts on: the destination for switch/create, the source for merge/remove. `base` and `target` give the other side:

| Operation | Bare vars | `base` | `target` |
|-----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| switch/create | destination | where you came from | = bare vars |
| commit (during merge/squash) | worktree being squashed | = bare vars | integration target |
| merge | feature being merged | = bare vars | merge target |
| remove | branch being removed | = bare vars | where you end up |

Pre and post hooks share the same perspective — `{{ branch | hash_port }}` produces the same port in `post-start` and `post-remove`. `cwd` is the worktree root where the hook command runs. It differs from `worktree_path` in three cases: pre-switch, where the hook runs in the source but `worktree_path` is the destination; post-remove, where the active worktree is gone so the hook runs in primary; and post-merge with removal, same — the active worktree is gone, so the hook runs in target.

Some variables are conditional: `upstream` requires remote tracking; `base` only appears in switch/create hooks; `target_worktree_path` requires the target to have a worktree; `pr_number`/`pr_url` are populated for `post-switch`, `pre-start`, and `post-start` hooks when creating via `pr:N` or `mr:N`; `vars` keys may not exist. Undefined variables error — use conditionals or defaults for optional behavior:

```toml
[pre-start]
# Rebase onto upstream if tracking a remote branch (e.g., wt switch --create feature origin/feature)
sync = "{% if upstream %}git fetch && git rebase {{ upstream }}{% endif %}"
```

Run any hook-firing command with `-v` to see the resolved variables for the actual invocation — each hook prints a `template variables:` block showing every in-scope variable and its value (`(unset)` for conditional vars that didn't populate, like `target_worktree_path` during `wt switch -`). Aliases do the same under `-v`: `wt -v <alias>` prints the alias's in-scope variables before the pipeline runs.

Variables use dot access and the `default` filter for missing keys. JSON object/array values are parsed automatically, so `{{ vars.config.port }}` works when the value is `{"port": 3000}`:

```toml
[post-start]
dev = "ENV={{ vars.env | default('development') }} npm start -- --port {{ vars.config.port | default('3000') }}"
```

## Worktrunk filters

Templates support Jinja2 filters for transforming values:

| Filter | Example | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `sanitize` | `{{ branch \| sanitize }}` | Replace `/` and `\` with `-` |
| `sanitize_db` | `{{ branch \| sanitize_db }}` | Database-safe identifier with hash suffix (`[a-z0-9_]`, max 48 chars) |
| `sanitize_hash` | `{{ branch \| sanitize_hash }}` | Filesystem-safe name with hash suffix for uniqueness |
| `hash` | `{{ branch \| hash }}` | 3-character base36 digest of the input |
| `hash_port` | `{{ branch \| hash_port }}` | Hash to port 10000-19999 |
| `dirname` | `{{ repo_path \| dirname }}` | Strip the last path component (`/a/b/c` → `/a/b`) |
| `basename` | `{{ repo_path \| basename }}` | Keep only the last path component (`/a/b/c` → `c`) |
| `codename(n)` | `{{ branch \| codename(2) }}` | Deterministic friendly words |

The `sanitize` filter makes branch names safe for filesystem paths. The `sanitize_db` filter produces database-safe identifiers — lowercase alphanumeric and underscores, no leading digits, with a 3-character hash suffix to avoid collisions and reserved words. The `sanitize_hash` filter produces a filesystem-safe name and appends a 3-character hash suffix when sanitization changed the input, so distinct originals never collide — already-safe names pass through unchanged. The `codename(n)` filter produces deterministic friendly names from an input string: `codename(1)` returns a noun, `codename(2)` returns `adjective-noun`, and higher counts add more adjectives. The pool is large (~1.26M combinations for `codename(2)`), so it usually stands alone as a worktree leaf:

```toml
# Friendly branch-derived worktree names, e.g. myproject.malleable-opah
worktree-path = "{{ repo_path }}/../{{ repo }}.{{ branch | codename(2) }}"
```

When you want both a friendly name and the original branch identity in the path, put the branch name in a parent directory:

```toml
worktree-path = "{{ repo_path }}/../worktrees/{{ branch | sanitize }}/{{ branch | codename(2) }}"
```

The `hash` filter is the bare 3-character base36 digest, useful for composing your own truncate-with-collision-avoidance recipes when an output budget is tight (e.g., Unix socket paths capped at 107 bytes):

```toml
# Truncated branch slug + hash: collisions remain disambiguated even when prefixes match
worktree-path = "/tmp/{{ (branch | sanitize)[:20] }}_{{ branch | sanitize | hash }}"
```

The `dirname` and `basename` filters traverse paths. They're useful for bare repos in a hidden directory like `myproject/.git`, where `{{ repo }}` resolves to `.git`:

```toml
# Place worktrees as siblings of the bare repo, named `<wrapper>.<branch>`
worktree-path = "{{ repo_path }}/../{{ repo_path | dirname | basename }}.{{ branch | sanitize }}"
```

The `hash_port` filter is useful for running dev servers on unique ports per worktree:

```toml
[post-start]
dev = "npm run dev -- --host {{ branch }}.localhost --port {{ branch | hash_port }}"
```

Hash any string, including concatenations:

```toml
# Unique port per repo+branch combination
dev = "npm run dev --port {{ (repo ~ '-' ~ branch) | hash_port }}"
```

Variables are shell-escaped automatically — quotes around `{{ ... }}` are unnecessary and can cause issues with special characters.

## Worktrunk functions

Templates also support functions for dynamic lookups:

| Function | Example | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `worktree_path_of_branch(branch)` | `{{ worktree_path_of_branch("main") }}` | Look up the path of a branch's worktree |

The `worktree_path_of_branch` function returns the filesystem path of a worktree given a branch name, or an empty string if no worktree exists for that branch. This is useful for referencing files in other worktrees:

```toml
[pre-start]
# Copy config from main worktree
setup = "cp {{ worktree_path_of_branch('main') }}/config.local {{ worktree_path }}"
```

## JSON context

Hooks receive all template variables as JSON on stdin, enabling complex logic that templates can't express:

```toml
[pre-start]
setup = "python3 scripts/pre-start-setup.py"
```

```python
import json, sys, subprocess
ctx = json.load(sys.stdin)
if ctx['branch'].startswith('feature/') and 'backend' in ctx['repo']:
    subprocess.run(['make', 'seed-db'])
```

## Copying untracked files

One specific command worth calling out: [`wt step copy-ignored`](https://worktrunk.dev/step/#wt-step-copy-ignored). Git worktrees share the repository but not untracked files, and this copies gitignored files between worktrees:

```toml
[post-start]
copy = "wt step copy-ignored"
```

# Running Hooks Manually

`wt hook <type>` runs hooks on demand — useful for testing during development, running in CI pipelines, or re-running after a failure.

```bash
$ wt hook pre-merge              # Run all pre-merge hooks
$ wt hook pre-merge test         # Run hooks named "test" from both sources
$ wt hook pre-merge test build   # Run hooks named "test" and "build"
$ wt hook pre-merge user:        # Run all user hooks
$ wt hook pre-merge project:     # Run all project hooks
$ wt hook pre-merge user:test    # Run only user's "test" hook
$ wt hook pre-merge --yes        # Skip approval prompts (for CI)
$ wt hook pre-start --branch=feature/test    # Override a template variable
$ wt hook pre-merge -- --extra args     # Forward tokens into {{ args }}
```

The `user:` and `project:` prefixes filter by source. Use `user:` or `project:` alone to run all hooks from that source, or `user:name` / `project:name` to run a specific hook.

```
$ wt hook pre-merge
◎ Running pre-merge project:test
  cargo test
    Finished test [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.12s
     Running unittests src/lib.rs (target/debug/deps/worktrunk-abc123)

```

```bash
$ wt hook post-start
◎ Running post-start: project @ ~/acme
```

## Passing values

`--KEY=VALUE` binds `KEY` whenever `{{ KEY }}` appears in any command of the hook — the same smart-routing rule `wt <alias>` uses. Built-in variables can be overridden: `--branch=foo` sets `{{ branch }}` inside hook templates (the worktree's actual branch doesn't move). Hyphens in keys become underscores: `--my-var=x` sets `{{ my_var }}`.

Any `--KEY=VALUE` whose key isn't referenced by a hook template forwards into `{{ args }}` as a literal `--KEY=VALUE` token. Tokens after `--` also forward into `{{ args }}` verbatim. `{{ args }}` renders as a space-joined, shell-escaped string; index with `{{ args[0] }}`, loop with `{% for a in args %}…{% endfor %}`, count with `{{ args | length }}`.

The long form `--var KEY=VALUE` is deprecated but still supported. It force-binds regardless of whether any hook template references `KEY` — useful when a template only references the key conditionally (e.g. `{% if override %}…{% endif %}`).

# Recipes

- [Eliminate cold starts](https://worktrunk.dev/tips-patterns/#eliminate-cold-starts): `wt step copy-ignored` in `post-start` shares build caches and dependencies; use a `[[post-start]]` pipeline when a later hook depends on the copy
- [Dev server per worktree](https://worktrunk.dev/tips-patterns/#dev-server-per-worktree): `hash_port` in `post-start` for launch and `post-remove` for cleanup, with optional subdomain routing
- [Database per worktree](https://worktrunk.dev/tips-patterns/#database-per-worktree): a `post-start` pipeline stores container name, port, and connection string as [per-branch vars](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#wt-config-state-vars) that later hooks reference
- [Progressive validation](https://worktrunk.dev/tips-patterns/#progressive-validation): quick lint/typecheck in `pre-commit`, expensive tests and builds in `pre-merge`
- [Target-specific hooks](https://worktrunk.dev/tips-patterns/#target-specific-hooks): branch on `{{ target }}` in `post-merge` for per-environment deploys
