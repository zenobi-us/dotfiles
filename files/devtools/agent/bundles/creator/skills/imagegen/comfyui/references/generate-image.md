Generate, edit, or modify an image using Comfy Cloud based on the user's description: $ARGUMENTS

Follow these steps exactly:

**Step 0 — Route partner-API requests directly.** If the user named a provider, model, or capability (e.g. "Flux Pro Ultra", "Nano Banana", "Kling", "DALL-E"), do one `search_nodes` lookup with the named term. If the matching node's category starts with `partner/`, try `partner_generate` first — see its tool description for the currently-wired model ids. Pass `type: "image"` plus the partner's model slug, `prompt`, and any optional fields (`aspect_ratio`/`seed`/`medias[]`). On success, return the artifact URL(s) and **stop** — do NOT continue with the workflow steps below. If `partner_generate` returns "unknown model" or "not yet implemented", or the matching node has no `partner/` prefix (OSS model), continue to Step 1.

1. Use `search_templates` to find a pre-built workflow template that matches the request (e.g. "text to image", "image to video", "style transfer", "inpainting"). If a good template exists, use it as the base workflow instead of building from scratch.

2. If no suitable template was found, use `search_models` to find an appropriate checkpoint model for the request. Pick the best match based on the user's description (e.g. realistic photo -> realistic checkpoint, anime -> anime checkpoint, SDXL for high quality).

3. If the user provides an input image (for img2img, style transfer, upscaling, etc.), use `upload_file` to upload it to Comfy Cloud first. Use the returned filename in a LoadImage node.

4. Build a ComfyUI API-format workflow JSON with the appropriate nodes (or use the template workflow). A standard text-to-image workflow uses: CheckpointLoaderSimple, CLIPTextEncode (positive and negative prompts), EmptyLatentImage, KSampler, VAEDecode, SaveImage. For img2img, replace EmptyLatentImage with LoadImage + VAEEncode.

5. **Validate the workflow has inputs and outputs before submitting.** Confirm the JSON contains:
   - At least one **input node** carrying the user's intent (CLIPTextEncode for prompts, LoadImage for img2img/style transfer, etc.).
   - At least one **output/save node** wired to the final image tensor (`SaveImage`, `PreviewImage`, or the partner node's own save output).

   API-backed partner nodes (Nano Banana, Gemini, Flux Kontext, etc.) often produce an image tensor but **do not include a save node by default** — you must add one and wire it to their output. Without it the job runs successfully but produces nothing retrievable, wasting compute. Do not skip this check.

6. Call `submit_workflow` with the workflow JSON.

7. Poll `get_job_status` every 3 seconds until the job is completed. Show the user a brief status update while waiting. If the user asks to cancel, use `cancel_job` with the prompt_id.

8. Call `get_output` to retrieve the generated image. Pass a short `description` parameter (e.g. "cat astronaut in space") so the output gets a descriptive name.

9. Display the image to the user:
   - In **GUI environments** (Claude Desktop): the response includes an `ARTIFACT_HTML:` block — create an HTML artifact using that exact HTML so the image appears in the side panel. The file is also saved to disk.
   - In **CLI/terminal environments** (Claude Code, Cursor): the response contains a temporary signed GCS download URL, a suggested save path, and a ready-to-run `curl` command on its own line. **Execute that `curl` command verbatim** via your shell/Bash tool — do not reconstruct it from the raw URL, and do not re-quote, re-encode, or strip any query parameters. The signature lives in the query string (`X-Goog-Signature=` and related params), and any modification will invalidate the link and the download will fail. After the file is saved, open it with `open` (macOS), `xdg-open` (Linux), or `start` (Windows).

If any step fails, show the error clearly and suggest what might have gone wrong (wrong model, invalid node configuration, etc.).
