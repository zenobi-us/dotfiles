Upscale an image using Comfy Cloud: $ARGUMENTS

Follow these steps exactly:

1. Use `search_templates` with queries like "upscale", "super resolution", or "image upscaler" to find a pre-built upscaling workflow template. If a good template exists, use it as the base workflow instead of building from scratch.

2. If no suitable template was found, use `search_models` with type "upscale_models" to find an appropriate upscaler model. Popular options: 4x-UltraSharp (general purpose), RealESRGAN_x4plus (photorealistic), RealESRGAN_x4plus_anime_6B (anime/illustration), 4x_NMKD-Siax_200k (balanced). For 2x upscale, look for 2x models.

3. The user must provide an input image. Use `upload_file` to upload it to Comfy Cloud. Use the returned filename in a LoadImage node.

4. Build a ComfyUI API-format workflow JSON for upscaling. A standard upscale workflow uses: LoadImage → UpscaleModelLoader → ImageUpscaleWithModel → SaveImage. For higher quality results with more control, you can use a two-pass approach: upscale first, then run through img2img with a checkpoint at low denoise (0.2-0.4) to add detail.

5. **Validate the workflow has inputs and outputs before submitting.** Confirm the JSON contains:
   - At least one **input node** (`LoadImage` for the source image).
   - At least one **output/save node** wired to the upscaled image (`SaveImage`, or the partner node's own save output).

   Without an output node the job runs successfully but produces nothing retrievable, wasting compute. Do not skip this check.

6. Call `submit_workflow` with the workflow JSON.

7. Poll `get_job_status` every 3 seconds until the job is completed. Show the user a brief status update while waiting. If the user asks to cancel, use `cancel_job` with the prompt_id.

8. Call `get_output` to retrieve the upscaled image. Pass a short `description` parameter (e.g. "upscaled-photo") so the suggested filename is descriptive, then run the returned curl command in the user's shell to download the file.

9. Display the result to the user. Mention the output resolution compared to the input if known.

If any step fails, show the error clearly. Common issues: input image too large for GPU memory (suggest downscaling first or using a tile-based upscaler like UltimateSDUpscale).
