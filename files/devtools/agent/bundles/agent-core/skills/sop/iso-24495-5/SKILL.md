# ISO/WD 24495-5 - Plain Language (Document Design) [PROVISIONAL DRAFT]

> **Provisional status:** ISO 24495-5 is a Working Draft (ISO/WD 24495-5) and is not yet published. This skill is original guidance based on the draft's public scope and established information design practice. It does not reproduce ISO text. Expect revision when the standard is published.

> **Sources:** several rules here paraphrase the Document design pattern library, version 0.6, June 2025. That library is by Waller, van der Waarde, Schriver, Slabbert, Cheek and Linsky, for the International Plain Language Federation. The wording in this skill is ours, and no substantial wording is copied from it. Read the [Document design pattern library at the International Plain Language Federation](https://www.iplfederation.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ISOpatternlibrary06.pdf) for the original.

Extends ISO 24495-1:2023 for the structural design of complex documents: reports, specifications, guides, contracts presented as documents, and long-form technical or health information. Design works together with linguistic cues to help readers find and navigate a document's structure and content.

**Design for readers who are not looking at the page.** The intended readers include everyone who uses the document. Some see it, some hear it through a screen reader, and some read it by touch.

A listener has no visual hierarchy. Their structure is the heading tree, the link text and the reading order. Every rule below is written to hold when the document is heard.

## Scope & Execution Boundaries

1. **Thinking Block Exemption:**
   - Internal layout planning and structural reasoning within thinking blocks (the `thought` and `thinking` tags) are **100% exempt** from these constraints.
   - Plan freely within thinking blocks. Apply document design rules strictly to final user-facing documents.

2. **Design as Engineering, Not Decoration:**
   - Base every design decision on a documented reader need (finding, navigating, comparing, acting). Never add visual elements for aesthetic effect alone.

3. **Content Primacy:**
   - Document design must **never** cut or distort content to fit a layout. Accuracy and completeness supersede visual tidiness.

## Required Templates

Read the matching template before writing any of these document types:

- **Architecture decision record (ADR):** Read the template file at `assets/adr-template.md`.
- **Runbook:** Read the template file at `assets/runbook-template.md`.
- **Design document:** Read the template file at `assets/design-doc-template.md`.

## Restructure an Existing Document

When asked to restructure an existing document:

1. Identify the reader tasks, current hierarchy, and navigation needs.
2. Preserve every prose passage and content item.
3. Change headings, list types, table structure and visual formatting. You may also move a whole sentence or block, unchanged. Move it only where its dependencies, its order against neighbouring steps, and the claim it qualifies all survive.
4. Build the opening block, the overview and the signposts from sentences the document already holds, or from wording the author gives you in the request. Promote a sentence only when it states the field directly, and stays both true and complete enough for that field once away from the paragraph it came from. Where the author's wording contradicts the document, promote neither and report the mismatch.
5. Where nothing serves, leave a marked slot such as `[Author needed: purpose]` and report it as a gap. This covers the overview's content as much as its label. Never supply the missing wording yourself.
6. Check the result against the hierarchy, navigation, structure, and signalling rules below.

Do not rewrite prose, change tone, or remove content. Those changes belong to Parts 1 to 3, and so does rewording a sentence to make it fit a slot. A wrong purpose sends a reader confidently in the wrong direction, which is worse than no purpose at all.

## Quantitative Rules & Hard Constraints (User-Facing Documents)

1. **Visual Hierarchy Limits:**
   - Use at most **3 heading levels** below the document title. Flatten deeper nesting into lists or tables.
   - Make headings state the section's message or task, not just its topic (*"Install the dependencies"* rather than *"Dependencies"*).
   - Two exceptions here, one override in rule 8, and no others. A document type with a published structure keeps that structure's section names, as a decision record keeps Context and Decision.
   - A reference section a reader jumps to by subject keeps the subject as its name, as a specification keeps Data Model. A section read in sequence gets a message or a task.
   - Reject a heading that jokes, puns or plays with words. Reject one built on a term the document has not yet explained, because a reader skimming meets the heading first.

2. **Navigation Aids:**
   - Add a table of contents or link list to any document with **6 or more sections**.
   - Keep heading wording identical between the table of contents and the section it points to.
   - Number headings when a reader must cite one by its identifier, and never below the depth limit above.

3. **Chunking & White Space:**
   - Present one idea per visual chunk (paragraph, list, table, or callout). Separate chunks with blank lines.
   - Never run two unrelated topics together in one paragraph or one table.

4. **Choosing the Right Structure:**
   - **Comparisons:** Use a table when readers must compare 2 or more items across shared attributes. Name the narrowest presentation the table must survive, then read it back at that width. Where nobody has named one, use repeated labelled records instead of a table, rather than shipping both.
   - **Sequences:** Use a numbered list for steps that must happen in order. Keep it an ordered list rather than numbers typed into a paragraph, so the sequence survives when the document is heard. A legal document's clause identifiers are the one exception, because no ordered list renders a compound identifier such as 4.2.1, and `iso-24495-2` governs them.
   - **Options and collections:** Use a bulleted list for unordered sets of 3 or more items. Keep each bullet to one paragraph carrying one idea, and nest bulleted lists no deeper than 2 levels. Promote longer material to a subsection.
   - **Branching routes:** When a procedure forks, use a decision table or a labelled set of conditions rather than one numbered list. A decision table with labelled routes is already the written form. Add prose only where the routes are drawn as a picture.
   - **Warnings and conditions:** Reserve a callout for a warning or condition that changes what the reader does. Merge adjacent callouts serving one purpose, and give each a word naming what it is.

5. **Consistent Visual Signalling:**
   - Give each visual device (bold, italics, blockquotes, code formatting, icons) **one meaning** per document and apply it consistently.
   - Never use the same device for two different meanings, or two devices for the same meaning. A text alternative is exempt only where the original is a picture or a diagram, or is not exposed to a screen reader. A table is excluded only where its headers identify every value and its reading order keeps the comparison intact. Where they do not, a concise equivalent is allowed.
   - **Never let a visual device carry meaning on its own.** Bold, colour, an icon and a position on the page are all silent to a listener. State the meaning in words as well. "Required fields are marked in red" fails; "Required fields are marked with the word required" works.

6. **Reaching Readers Who Cannot See the Page:**
   - **Link text names its destination.** A screen reader can list every link in a document, read aloud without the sentence around it. "Click here" and a bare web address tell that reader nothing.
   - **Every image that carries meaning has alternative text** describing what it shows, not what it is. An image that carries no meaning is decorative and may say so.
   - **Tables carry a header row**, because a listener hears each cell announced against its column name.
   - **The reading order is the document order.** A sidebar or a floating callout only makes sense out of sequence, so give each one its own heading in the flow.

7. **The Opening Block:**
   - Open every document with its title, a one-line statement of its purpose, and its version or date.
   - Name the intended reader in that block. Part 1 decides who that reader is; this rule decides where the answer appears.
   - Give each field its minimum. Purpose states the reader's task and the document's scope. The reader line names the primary audience. The referral names the alternative and when to use it.
   - Where the document cites this skill or ISO 24495-5, say in the document that the standard is an unpublished draft.

8. **Layering the Detail:**
   - Label the overview explicitly in any document with 6 or more sections, or one whose conclusion readers need before the detail. A reader who stops at the overview then knows what they hold.
   - That label is the section's heading, and it names the section rather than its message. This rule overrides the heading rule for that one heading, and for no other. It keeps the document's conclusion, the action required, and any essential qualification.
   - Give that label a heading, never bold text or a visual treatment alone. A listener reaches it through the heading list or not at all.
   - Move detail that only some readers need into footnotes, an appendix, or a collapsible block, and keep it reachable from the main path.
   - Use at most **3 levels**: overview, main body, and optional detail. Part 3 governs a technical explanation's stages, and states where each one lands in these levels.

9. **Readers Who Have the Wrong Document:**
   - Tell a reader who needs something else where to go. Link the related documents, the other language versions, or a person to ask.
   - Put that signpost where a reader will look on realising the document is wrong. Near the top works, or at the end of the opening section.
   - Leave it out when no alternative exists, rather than shipping an empty heading.

## Pre-Output Self-Audit Checklist

Before outputting a complex document, audit against these checks:
- [ ] **Hierarchy depth:** Are there 3 or fewer heading levels below the title?
- [ ] **Heading quality:** Does each heading state its section's message, or a name its genre expects, free of wordplay and of terms not yet explained?
- [ ] **Navigation:** Does a document with 6 or more sections carry a table of contents worded identically to its headings?
- [ ] **Numbering:** Are headings numbered only where a reader must cite one by its identifier?
- [ ] **Chunking:** Does each chunk carry one idea, separated from the next by a blank line?
- [ ] **Structure fit:** Are sequences in ordered lists, sets in bullets, and forks in a decision table or labelled conditions, with a legal document's clause identifiers exempt?
- [ ] **Comparisons:** Is the table tested at a named target width, or are labelled records used because no width is named?
- [ ] **Restraint:** Is every bulleted item one paragraph on one idea, nested no deeper than 2 levels, with longer material promoted to a subsection?
- [ ] **Callouts:** Does each change what the reader does, with adjacent ones merged and each named in a word?
- [ ] **Signal consistency:** Does each device carry one meaning, no two devices carry the same meaning, and no meaning ride on a device alone?
- [ ] **Alternatives:** Is a text alternative present only beside a picture or diagram, or beside a table whose headers miss values or whose order breaks the comparison?
- [ ] **Links and images:** Does link text name its destination, does a meaningful image say what it shows, and is a decorative one marked as decorative?
- [ ] **Tables heard:** Does every table carry a header row, with headers that identify each value beneath them?
- [ ] **Reading order:** Does document order match reading order, with each sidebar and displaced callout given its own heading?
- [ ] **Opening block:** Does the document open with its title, a one-line purpose naming the reader's task and scope, the primary audience, and a version or date?
- [ ] **Overview contents:** Where needed, does it keep the conclusion, the required action and every essential qualification?
- [ ] **Overview label and detail:** Is the label a heading rather than bold text alone, and has the detail moved to footnotes, an appendix or a collapsible block?
- [ ] **Levels:** Are there 3 or fewer levels of detail, and is the optional detail still reachable?
- [ ] **Signposting:** Is the referral near the top or ending the opening section, naming its destination and when to use it, and absent where nothing else exists?
- [ ] **Preserved:** On a restructure, was every prose passage and content item kept, with no prose rewritten and no tone changed?
- [ ] **Safe moves:** Did every moved sentence or block keep its dependencies, its order against neighbouring steps, and the claim it qualifies?
- [ ] **Never invented:** Did every promoted sentence come unchanged from the document or the author, state its field directly, stay true and complete, with mismatches reported and gaps marked?
- [ ] **Content primacy:** Did accuracy and completeness survive every structural choice, with nothing cut or distorted to fit a layout?
- [ ] **Evidence over aesthetics:** Does every design element serve a reader need?
- [ ] **Provisional label:** Where the document cites Part 5, does it say the standard is an unpublished draft?
