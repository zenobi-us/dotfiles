# try-catch

The try-catch expression allows you to handle errors gracefully by providing a fallback value when an expression fails.

## Syntax

```
try <expr> catch <expr>
try <expr> catch(<binder>) <expr>
```

## Behavior

- If the `try` expression succeeds, its result is returned
- If the `try` expression fails (produces an error), the `catch` expression is evaluated instead
- The `catch` expression receives the same input as the `try` expression
- With `catch(<binder>)`, `<binder>` is bound to a dict describing the failure (currently `{"message": <string>}`) for the duration of the `catch` expression
- `break`/`continue` inside the `try` expression are not treated as errors; they propagate to the enclosing loop instead of triggering `catch`

## Examples

### Basic Error Handling

```mq
# When the expression succeeds
try: "value" catch: "unknown"

# When the expression fails
try: get("missing") catch: "default"
```

### Chaining with Pipe

```mq
# Try to parse as JSON, fallback to raw string
try: from_json() catch: self

# Complex fallback logic
try: do get("data") | from_json(); catch: []
```

### Nested Try-Catch

```mq
# Multiple fallback levels
try: get("primary") catch: try: get("secondary") catch: "default"
```

### Error Binder

```mq
# Bind the failure to `e` and inspect its message
try: error("boom") catch(e): e["message"]
# => "boom"
```

## Error Suppression (`?`)

The error suppression operator `?` provides a concise way to handle errors by returning `None` when an expression fails, instead of raising an error. This is equivalent to using a regular `try-catch` with a default fallback.

### Examples

```mq
# Equivalent to a regular try-catch with a default value
get("missing")?
```

In this example, if `get("missing")` fails, the result will be `None` rather than an error.
