# Transform, filter, and reduce arrays

Goal: Apply the usual `map`/`filter`/`fold` trio to arrays inside an mq query, useful once a query has collected values into a list and you need to post-process them.

Prerequisites: None.

## Map: transform each element

```bash
$ mq -I null 'map([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], fn(x): x + 1;)'
```

```
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

## Filter: keep elements matching a condition

```bash
$ mq -I null 'filter([5, 15, 8, 20, 3], fn(x): x > 10;)'
```

```
[15, 20]
```

## Fold: combine elements into a single value

```bash
$ mq -I null 'fold([1, 2, 3, 4], 0, fn(acc, x): acc + x;)'
```

```
10
```

## Notes

- The array can also come from the pipe instead of being passed explicitly, and the three chain together: `[5, 15, 8, 20, 3] | filter(fn(x): x > 10;) | fold(0, fn(acc, x): acc + x;)` gives `35`.
- These compose naturally with Markdown selectors, e.g. `.h.depth | filter(fn(x): x <= 2;)` to keep only the depths of h1/h2 headings collected across a document (with `-A`).
