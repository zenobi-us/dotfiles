# Control when large file sets run in parallel

Goal: Understand and tune mq's automatic parallel processing for batches of many files, so a big run doesn't stall on I/O one file at a time.

Prerequisites: None.

## Query

By default, mq automatically switches to parallel processing once a run covers more than 10 files, no flag needed:

```bash
$ mq '.h1' docs/**/*.md
```

Use `-P <n>` to change that threshold, e.g. force parallel mode even for a small batch while testing:

```bash
$ mq -P 1 '.h1' docs/**/*.md
```

Or raise it, to keep small-to-medium batches sequential (useful if the query has ordering side effects):

```bash
$ mq -P 50 '.h1' docs/**/*.md
```

## Notes

- `-P` is a *threshold* (files to process before switching to parallel), not a worker count. It doesn't limit how many files run concurrently.
- Output order across files is not guaranteed once parallel processing kicks in. If order matters, raise the threshold above your file count, or sort downstream.
