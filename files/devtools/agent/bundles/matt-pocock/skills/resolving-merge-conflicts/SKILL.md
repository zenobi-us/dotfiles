## Language

All agent-authored prose MUST follow **ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English**. Apply it to questions, explanations, recommendations, issue text, reports, handoffs, and procedures.

- Use short, complete sentences and active voice.
- Use one term for one meaning.
- Put conditions before commands.
- Use imperative sentences for procedures.
- Keep code, identifiers, commands, quoted text, product names, and exact domain terms unchanged.
- Use the `simple-english` skill for the full rule set.

## Context resolution

Before reading or writing workflow or domain artifacts, run the shared-context CLI procedure from `agent-core:shared-context` in the repository root. Use its `root` output as `ALIGNMENT_ROOT` and its `repository-root` output for source code and ordinary project files. Do not inspect the prompt or environment, or derive an alignment path by hand.

For a write under a shared `ALIGNMENT_ROOT`, use `cli.ts anchor` before choosing a source directory, run `cli.ts index <dir>` after adding or removing a file in that directory, and read the shared-context publishing procedure after the write. Follow [ALIGNMENT-ROOT.md](../../ALIGNMENT-ROOT.md) for the complete rule.



1. **See the current state** of the merge/rebase. Check git history, and the conflicting files.

2. **Find the primary sources** for each conflict. Understand deeply why each change was made, and what the original intent was. Read the commit messages, check the PRs, and use `/reading-and-writing-tickets` to resolve and read original issues or tickets.

3. **Resolve each hunk.** Preserve both intents where possible. Where incompatible, pick the one matching the merge's stated goal and note the trade-off. Do **not** invent new behaviour. Always resolve; never `--abort`.

4. Discover the project's **automated checks** and run them, typically typecheck, then tests, then format. Fix anything the merge broke.

5. **Finish the merge/rebase.** Stage everything and commit. If rebasing, continue the rebase process until all commits are rebased.
