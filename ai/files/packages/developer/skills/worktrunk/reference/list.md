# wt list

List worktrees and their status.

Shows uncommitted changes, divergence from the default branch and remote, and optional CI status and LLM summaries.

The table renders progressively: branch names, paths, and commit hashes appear immediately, then status, divergence, and other columns fill in as background git operations complete.

## Full mode

`--full` adds columns that require network access or LLM calls: [CI status](#ci-status) (GitHub/GitLab pipeline pass/fail), line diffs since the merge-base, and [LLM-generated summaries](#llm-summaries) of each branch's changes.

## Examples

List all worktrees:

```
$ wt list

Output as JSON for scripting:

## Columns

| Column | Shows |
|--------|-------|
| Branch | Branch name |
| Status | Compact symbols (see below) |
| HEAD± | Uncommitted changes: +added -deleted lines |
| main↕ | Commits ahead/behind default branch |
| main…± | Line diffs since the merge-base with the default branch; `--full` only |
| Summary | LLM-generated branch summary; requires `--full`, `summary = true`, and [`commit.generation`](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#commit) [experimental] |
| Remote⇅ | Commits ahead/behind tracking branch |
| CI | Pipeline status; `--full` only |
| Path | Worktree directory |
| URL | Dev server URL from project config; dimmed if port is not listening |
| Commit | Short hash (8 chars) |
| Age | Time since last commit |
| Message | Last commit message (truncated) |

Note: `main↕` and `main…±` refer to the default branch — the header label stays `main` for compactness. `main…±` uses a merge-base (three-dot) diff.

### CI status

The CI column shows GitHub/GitLab pipeline status:

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `●` green | All checks passed |
| `●` blue | Checks running |
| `●` red | Checks failed |
| `●` yellow | Merge conflicts with base |
| `●` gray | No checks configured |
| `⚠` yellow | Fetch error (rate limit, network) |
| (blank) | No upstream or no PR/MR |

CI indicators are clickable links to the PR or pipeline page. Any CI dot appears dimmed when unpushed local changes make the status stale. PRs/MRs are checked first, then branch workflows/pipelines for branches with an upstream. Local-only branches show blank; remote-only branches — visible with `--remotes` — get CI status detection. Results are cached for 30-60 seconds; use `wt config state` to view or clear.

### LLM summaries [experimental]

Reuses the [`commit.generation`](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#commit) command — the same LLM that generates commit messages. Enable with `summary = true` in `[list]` config; requires `--full`. Results are cached until the branch's diff changes.

## Status symbols

The Status column has multiple subcolumns. Within each, only the first matching symbol is shown (listed in priority order):

| Subcolumn | Symbol | Meaning |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Working tree (1) | `+` | Staged files |
| Working tree (2) | `!` | Modified files (unstaged) |
| Working tree (3) | `?` | Untracked files |
| Worktree | `✘` | Merge conflicts |
| | `⤴` | Rebase in progress |
| | `⤵` | Merge in progress |
| | `/` | Branch without worktree |
| | `⚑` | Branch-worktree mismatch (branch name doesn't match worktree path) |
| | `⊟` | Prunable (directory missing) |
| | `⊞` | Locked worktree |
| Default branch | `^` | Is the default branch |
| | `∅` | Orphan branch (no common ancestor with the default branch) |
| | `✗` | Would conflict if merged to the default branch; with `--full`, includes uncommitted changes |
| | `_` | Same commit as the default branch, clean |
| | `–` | Same commit as the default branch, uncommitted changes |
| | `⊂` | Content [integrated](https://worktrunk.dev/remove/#branch-cleanup) into the default branch or target |
| | `↕` | Diverged from the default branch |
| | `↑` | Ahead of the default branch |
| | `↓` | Behind the default branch |
| Remote | `\|` | In sync with remote |
| | `⇅` | Diverged from remote |
| | `⇡` | Ahead of remote |
| | `⇣` | Behind remote |

Rows are dimmed when [safe to delete](https://worktrunk.dev/remove/#branch-cleanup) (`_` same commit with clean working tree or `⊂` content integrated).

### Placeholder symbols

These appear across all columns while the table is loading:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `·` | Data is loading, or collection timed out / branch too stale |
