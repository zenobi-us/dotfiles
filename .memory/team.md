## Notes

### Epic Split Rationale

The original "Pi Extensions Development" epic combined two unrelated work streams:

1. **Agent Management** (command-line tooling)
   - Focused on CLI commands for agent CRUD operations
   - Completed implementation
   - No dependency on theme system

2. **Theme Visualization** (visual TUI widgets)
   - Focused on rendering theme colors
   - Not yet started
   - No dependency on agent system

**Decision:** Split into independent epics to maintain focus and follow miniproject guideline that "only ONE epic should be active at a time."

### Compliance with miniproject Guidelines

- ✅ Each epic has clear vision and success criteria
- ✅ All phases link to parent epic
- ✅ Phases have start/end criteria
- ✅ Old epic archived (not deleted)
- ✅ Learning files preserved
- ✅ Only one epic active at a time (pending human decision)
- ✅ All files follow naming conventions

### Next Session Actions

**Ready for:** Theme API research and implementation

Recommended workflow:
1. Research Pi theme system to understand color access methods
2. Create research file documenting findings
3. Begin MVP implementation of theme palette widget
4. Test with default themes
5. Iterate based on findings
