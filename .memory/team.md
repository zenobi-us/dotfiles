## Notes

Epic structure was created retroactively on 2026-01-11 to organize existing work that was initiated without proper epic definition. This violates the miniproject guideline that "EVERY project MUST start with an epic definition before phases are created." 

Going forward, all new work will follow proper workflow: Epic → Research → Phase Planning → Task Breakdown.
