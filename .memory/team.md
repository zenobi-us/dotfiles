## Notes

### Epic 3 Rationale

Epic 2 successfully delivered a functional theme palette tool with:
- ✅ 47 colors across 8 categories
- ✅ Responsive layout system
- ✅ Component architecture (V2)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

Epic 3 focuses on enhancing the user experience by:
- Adding proper modal architecture
- Implementing visual affordances (escape indicator)
- Creating better component composition (ThemeApp → Modal → Palette)
- Polishing the application feel

**Why split from Epic 2?**
1. Original epic scope complete - all success criteria met
2. New requirements - modal architecture not in original vision
3. Different focus - UX refinement vs. functional delivery
4. Architectural changes - new component layers require separate planning
5. Timeline - original 1 day complete; enhancement is 3-4 additional days

### Compliance with miniproject Guidelines

- ✅ Each epic has clear vision and success criteria
- ✅ All phases link to parent epic
- ✅ Phases have start/end criteria
- ✅ Completed epics properly closed (Epic 1 & 2)
- ✅ Learning files preserved
- ✅ Only one epic active at a time (Epic 3)
- ✅ All files follow naming conventions
- ✅ Epic split rationale documented

### Next Session Actions

**Ready for:** Component architecture design phase

Recommended workflow:
1. Design ThemeApp component interface and responsibilities
2. Define Modal component API (border, title, escape affordance)
3. Plan component composition and data flow
4. Document hierarchy and create architecture diagram
5. Get design approval before implementation

**Critical Path:** Phase 1 design blocks all implementation work. Complete design before moving to Phase 2.
