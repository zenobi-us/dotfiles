# Epic: pi-interview pi-tui questionnaire UI

## Vision/Goal
Create a pi-tui-native questionnaire experience in Pi that can present single/multi choice and text prompts without launching an external HTML/browser flow.

## Success Criteria
- Source and behavior model for current `pi-interview` is confirmed from local code (or explicit gap is resolved).
- A concrete implementation design exists for question rendering, input handling, navigation, and submission in pi-tui.
- A scoped implementation task list exists with risks and dependencies.

## Phases
- [Phase 1: Source Discovery & Feasibility](phase-3a5f1c8d-source-discovery-and-feasibility.md)

## Dependencies
- Access to actual `pi-interview` source implementation (currently not found in this repository).
- Confirmed target location (new extension in this repo vs upstream package contribution).
