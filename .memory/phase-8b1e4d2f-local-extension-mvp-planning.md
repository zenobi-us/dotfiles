# Phase: Local extension MVP planning

## Overview
Translate confirmed product decisions into implementable stories/tasks for a local Dotfiles Pi extension that replaces `interview` with a pi-tui UI.

## Deliverables
- Story definitions with acceptance criteria for:
  - core questionnaire UI flow
  - image question support in pi-tui
  - replacement of `interview` command behavior
- Task breakdown for extension scaffolding, state machine, validation, and response contract.
- Risk notes for feature parity gaps vs browser implementation.

## Tasks
- (to be added after story definition)

## Dependencies
- Confirm extension location in this repo (target folder/package).
- Confirm migration strategy for existing `interview` consumers.

## Next Steps
- Write Story 1: core question rendering and navigation.
- Write Story 2: image input/attachment flow in pi-tui.
- Write Story 3: command replacement semantics and compatibility.
- Break stories into implementation tasks.
