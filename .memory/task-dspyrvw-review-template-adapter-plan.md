# Task: Review TemplateAdapter phase plan

## Objective
Obtain human confirmation that the newly proposed epic + phase breakdown for the TemplateAdapter Pi extension covers the required scope before creating execution tasks.

## Related Story
N/A

## Steps
1. Read `epic-dspya1b2-template-adapter-extension.md` and the four phase files (`dspya101`–`dspya104`).
2. Validate that the implementation plan leverages `dspy-template-adapter` capabilities (messages, parse modes, helper registry, preview/parse flows) and fits Pi extension constraints.
3. Confirm priority (does this supersede epic 9c7e21ab or run in parallel?).
4. Provide approval or change requests.

## Expected Outcome
Human reviewer approves the plan or supplies feedback that can be captured as follow-up tasks.

## Actual Outcome
Pending human review.

## Lessons Learned
TBD after review.
