# Phase: Source discovery and feasibility

## Overview
Investigate available source code for `pi-interview` and identify concrete implementation patterns for a pi-tui questionnaire UI.

## Deliverables
- Research document with verified file evidence.
- One completed task documenting source discovery outcome.
- Updated summary/todo/team pointers for this session.

## Tasks
- [task-5b2d7e91-repo-source-audit-pi-interview.md](task-5b2d7e91-repo-source-audit-pi-interview.md)

## Dependencies
- Repository-local availability of `pi-interview` implementation.
- Existing pi-tui component patterns in installed code.

## Next Steps
- Confirm with Q where the authoritative `pi-interview` source should be read from.
- Draft implementation plan once source access is confirmed.
