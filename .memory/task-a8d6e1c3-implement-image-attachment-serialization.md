# Task: Implement image attachment serialization

## Objective
Transform validated image answers into the attachment structure expected by interview consumers.

## Steps
1. Define output mapping from image answer state to attachment payload.
2. Ensure serialization preserves deterministic ordering and metadata.
3. Integrate serialization into final interview response assembly.
4. Add tests for single and multi-image answer payloads.

## Expected Outcome
Image responses are returned in compatible attachment format for downstream use.

## Actual Outcome
Not started.

## Lessons Learned
Pending execution.
