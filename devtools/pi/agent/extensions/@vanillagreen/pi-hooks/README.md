# @vanillagreen/pi-hooks

![pi-hooks settings panel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanillagreencom/vstack/main/pi-extensions/pi-hooks/assets/hooks-settings.png)

First-class Pi port of the vstack safety hooks. It also runs shell scripts for Pi events. Each hook is independently toggleable.

## Hooks

| Hook | Pi event | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Block bare `cd` | `tool_call` (bash) | Blocks bare `cd /path` commands with no subshell or chaining. Use `(cd /path && command)` instead. |
| Pre-commit fmt + clippy | `tool_call` (bash) | When `git commit` targets the active project repo, runs `cargo fmt --check` then `cargo clippy` in async child processes so Pi stays responsive. Blocks on failure. Skips commits targeting other repos and only fires when `.rs` files are staged or modified; if the bash command contains `git add`, untracked `.rs` files are treated conservatively as possibly staged by that command. |
| Post-edit clippy | `tool_result` (edit/write of `.rs`) | Runs workspace clippy after `.rs` edits and appends issues mentioning the edited file. Advisory only — doesn't undo the edit. |
| End-of-turn clippy | `turn_end` | If `.rs` files were touched during the turn, runs workspace clippy and surfaces errors via UI notification. Advisory only. |
| Shell event hooks | all Pi events | Runs scripts from `~/.pi/agent/hooks/<event>/` and trusted project `.pi/hooks/<event>/`. Scripts receive event JSON on stdin. |

These implement the same safety goals as the bash hooks in `vstack/hooks/`, with Pi-specific mechanics where the in-process event loop needs different handling: the pre-commit hook runs cargo checks via async child processes and first proves the commit targets the active project repo, so unrelated fixture commits do not freeze the session.

## Shell event hooks

Put scripts in one of these directories:

```text
~/.pi/agent/hooks/<eventname>/<scriptname>
.pi/hooks/<eventname>/<scriptname>
```

Global scripts run first. Project scripts run only after Pi trusts the project. Scripts run with `bash`, the Pi working directory, event JSON on stdin, and these environment variables:

- `PI_HOOK_EVENT`
- `PI_HOOK_SCOPE`
- `PI_HOOK_SCRIPT`
- `PI_HOOK_CWD`

If a `tool_call` script exits non-zero, Pi blocks the tool call. If a `session_before_*` script exits non-zero, Pi cancels that session action. Other failures show a warning.

## Install

```bash
vstack add --pi-extension pi-hooks
```

Or as part of `vstack add --all`. Refresh with `vstack refresh`.

Via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vanillagreen/pi-hooks):

```bash
pi install npm:@vanillagreen/pi-hooks
```

## Settings

Open `/extensions:settings`; settings appear under the **Hooks** tab.

Project settings in `.pi/settings.json` apply only after Pi marks the workspace trusted; before trust, vstack Pi extensions read user/global settings only.

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Enable hooks | Master toggle. Disable to make the extension inert without uninstalling. |
| Block bare cd | Toggle the bare-cd block hook. |
| Pre-commit fmt + clippy | Toggle the pre-commit hook. |
| Post-edit clippy | Toggle the post-edit advisory hook. |
| End-of-turn clippy | Toggle the end-of-turn advisory hook. |
| Clippy timeout | Max ms per clippy invocation. Advisory post-edit/end-of-turn clippy timeouts are abandoned so work can continue; blocking pre-commit fmt/clippy timeouts block the commit with a timeout reason. Pre-commit checks run asynchronously, so long checks may delay the commit gate without freezing the Pi TUI or bridge. |
| Shell event hooks | Enables scripts under `~/.pi/agent/hooks/<event>/` and trusted project `.pi/hooks/<event>/`. |
| Shell hook timeout | Max ms per shell event script. |
