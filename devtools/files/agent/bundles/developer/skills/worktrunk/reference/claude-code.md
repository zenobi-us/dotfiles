# Claude Code Integration

The worktrunk Claude Code plugin provides four features:

1. **Configuration skill** — Documentation Claude Code can read, so it can help set up LLM commits, hooks, and troubleshoot issues
2. **Worktree isolation** — When Claude Code agents create isolated worktrees, the plugin routes creation and removal through `wt` instead of raw `git`
3. **Activity tracking** — Status markers in `wt list` showing which worktrees have active Claude sessions (🤖 working, 💬 waiting)
4. **`/wt-switch-create` command** — Creates a worktrunk worktree and moves the current Claude session into it

## Installation

Recommended:

```bash
wt config plugins claude install
```

Manual equivalent:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add max-sixty/worktrunk
claude plugin install worktrunk@worktrunk
```

## Configuration skill

The plugin includes a skill — documentation that Claude Code can read — covering worktrunk's configuration system. After installation, Claude Code can help with:

- Setting up LLM-generated commit messages
- Adding project hooks (pre-start, pre-merge, pre-commit)
- Configuring worktree path templates
- Fixing shell integration issues

Claude Code is designed to load the skill automatically when it detects worktrunk-related questions.

## Activity tracking

The plugin tracks Claude sessions with status markers in `wt list`:

```bash
$ wt list
  <b>Branch</b>       <b>Status</b>        <b>HEAD±</b>    <b>main↕</b>  <b>Remote⇅</b>  <b>Path</b>                 <b>Commit</b>    <b>Age</b>   <b>Message</b>
@ main             <span class=d>^</span><span class=d>⇡</span>                         <span class=g>⇡1</span>      .                    <span class=d>33323bc1</span>  <span class=d>1d</span>    <span class=d>Initial commit</span>

<span class=d>○</span> <span class=d>Showing 4 worktrees, 2 with changes, 2 ahead</span>
```

- 🤖 — Claude is working
- 💬 — Claude is waiting for input

### Manual status markers

Set status markers manually for any workflow:

```bash
$ wt config state marker set "🚧"                   # Current branch
$ wt config state marker set "✅" --branch feature  # Specific branch
$ git config worktrunk.state.feature.marker '{"marker":"💬","set_at":0}'  # Direct
```

## Worktree isolation

Claude Code agents can run in isolated worktrees (`isolation: "worktree"`). By default, Claude Code creates these with `git worktree add`. The plugin's `WorktreeCreate` and `WorktreeRemove` hooks route this through `wt switch --create` and `wt remove` instead, so worktrees created by agents get worktrunk's naming conventions, hooks, and lifecycle management.

## `/wt-switch-create` command

`/wt-switch-create <branch> [<repo>] [-- <task>]` starts work in a fresh worktree without leaving the session. It creates (or re-enters) the named worktrunk worktree — sibling layout `<repo>.<branch>/`, not `.claude/worktrees/` — switches the session's working directory into it, then runs the task there. An optional second token names a different repository to create the worktree in; the task is whatever follows `--` (or, with no `--`, whatever follows the branch). The command rides the same `WorktreeCreate` hook as agent isolation, so the worktree gets worktrunk's naming, hooks, and lifecycle.

On session exit the worktree is offered for removal via the `WorktreeRemove` hook; one with uncommitted changes is kept rather than removed.

## Statusline

`wt list statusline --format=claude-code` outputs a single-line status for the Claude Code statusline. When the CI status cache is stale, this fetches from the network — typically 1–2 seconds — making it suitable for async statuslines but too slow for synchronous shell prompts. If a faster version would be helpful, please [open an issue](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues).

When Claude Code provides context window usage via stdin JSON, a moon phase gauge appears (🌕→🌑 as context fills).

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "wt list statusline --format=claude-code"
  }
}
```
