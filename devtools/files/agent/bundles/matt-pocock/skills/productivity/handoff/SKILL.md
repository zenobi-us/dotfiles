## Language

All agent-authored prose MUST follow **ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English**. Apply it to questions, explanations, recommendations, issue text, reports, handoffs, and procedures.

- Use short, complete sentences and active voice.
- Use one term for one meaning.
- Put conditions before commands.
- Use imperative sentences for procedures.
- Keep code, identifiers, commands, quoted text, product names, and exact domain terms unchanged.
- Use the `simple-english` skill for the full rule set.

Write a handoff document summarising the current conversation so a fresh agent can continue the work. Save to the temporary directory of the user's OS - not the current workspace.

Include a "suggested skills" section in the document, which suggests skills that the agent should invoke.

Do not duplicate content already captured in other artifacts (specs, plans, ADRs, issues, commits, diffs). Reference them by path or URL instead.

Redact any sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, or personally identifiable information.

If the user passed arguments, treat them as a description of what the next session will focus on and tailor the doc accordingly.
