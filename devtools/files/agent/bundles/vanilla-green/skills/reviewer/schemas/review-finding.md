# Review Finding Schema

All review/QA agents output JSON to `[worktree-path]/tmp/review-{agent}-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json`.

`{agent}` is your FULL agent name, including its `reviewer-` prefix. For `reviewer-security` the file is `review-reviewer-security-20260720-141530.json`. The doubled `review-reviewer-` is correct — do not shorten or de-duplicate it to `review-security-…`; orch's `review-artifact-check` globs the literal full agent name and reports the artifact `missing` otherwise.

Create the JSON artifact with the active harness file-write/edit tool. In Codex, use `apply_patch` to add or update the target file under `tmp/`. Do not use shell redirection, heredocs, `tee`, `echo >`, command substitution, or redirected `cat` writes for review artifacts.

## Verdict Rules

- `action_required`: 1+ items in `blockers[]`
- `pass`: `blockers[]` empty (suggestions may exist)

## qa_metadata

Per-agent QA payload (see `workflows/qa-review.md`); `{}` when there is none. A reviewer that could not actually perform its review must set `{"review_performed": false, "reason": "<snake_case_reason>"}` instead of a bare pass — orch's `review-artifact-check` rejects such artifacts with reason `no_review` regardless of verdict, so a self-reported no-review can never satisfy review acceptance. Artifacts without `qa_metadata` are validated as usual.

Declaring `qa_metadata` also commits the artifact to the finding arrays: an artifact with a `qa_metadata` object whose `blockers[]` or `suggestions[]` is missing or not an array is rejected by `review-artifact-check` with reason `incomplete` — a truncated write can keep `verdict`/`summary` while silently losing the findings, and such a verdict cannot be trusted (`questions[]` is exempt: it is PR-comment-triage-only). Artifacts without `qa_metadata` keep the tolerant existence + `verdict` validation.

## Arrays

- `blockers[]`: Items that block PR merge — dev must fix (may escalate to issues if unfixable)
- `suggestions[]`: Non-blocking improvements — categorized by review agent
- `questions[]`: Questions needing response (PR comment triage only)

## Item Fields (blockers/suggestions)

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | Yes | Sequential number within array |
| `title` | Yes | Concise issue title (5-10 words) — used if item becomes a tracked issue |
| `location` | Yes | Stable file path with function/struct names for precision (no line numbers — they go stale). If line or diff-hunk evidence is useful, include it in `description`. |
| `description` | Yes | Problem statement |
| `recommendation` | Yes | Actionable fix/improvement steps |
| `priority` | Yes | 1-4 (P1=Urgent, P2=High, P3=Normal, P4=Low) |
| `estimate` | Yes | 1-5 points (1=hours, 2=half-day, 3=day, 4=2-3 days, 5=week+) |
| `category` | Suggestions only | `fix` (apply in this PR) or `issue` (track separately) |

### Description Quality

`category: "issue"` items become tracked issues — write at issue quality.

| Field | Blockers / fix items | Issue items (`category: "issue"`) |
|-------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `description` | Brief (1 sentence OK) | 2-3 sentences: what, why, impact |
| `recommendation` | Brief fix instruction | Bullet-list requirements (`* item`) |

## Question Fields (PR comment triage only)

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | Yes | Sequential number |
| `location` | Yes | File path (or "general") |
| `question` | Yes | The question being asked |
| `draft_response` | Yes | Suggested response to post |
| `source` | Yes | Comment author |
| `source_id` | Yes | Thread or comment ID for reply routing |
| `source_type` | Yes | `inline` or `pr-level` |

## Priority

1=Urgent > 2=High > 3=Normal > 4=Low

## Estimate

Points (1-5): 1=hours, 2=half-day, 3=day, 4=2-3 days, 5=week+
