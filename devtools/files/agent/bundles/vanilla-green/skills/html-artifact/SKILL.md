# HTML Artifact

Use when the user wants a human-readable artifact from a conversation, plan, approach, report, review, explainer, prototype, or custom editor instead of a long reply or Markdown file.

Rules:
1. Always write one standalone `.html` file with inline CSS/JS and no build step.
2. Start from the closest `templates/` file, then replace demo content with the user's content.
3. Default path: `artifacts/<short-slug>.html` unless the user gave a path; create parent dirs.
4. After writing, open it in the user's default browser and give the `file://` link in chat.
5. Chat reply stays short: link + one-line note.
