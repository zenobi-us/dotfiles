# Review Workflow

On-demand code review for the current session. Reviews recent commits, presents findings, and offers to fix selected items.

## Inputs

| Command | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `review` | Review uncommitted changes since last commit |
| `review all` | Review all branch changes vs base (committed + uncommitted) |
| `review last [N]` | Review last N commits |
| `review [HASH]` | Review changes in specific commit |

**Always standalone** — no managed lifecycle, no caller context parameters.

**Init:**
```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/review-init
```

Use the JSON fields as `BRANCH`, `WT_PATH`, and `ISSUE_ID`. If `issue_id` is empty, skip workflow-state steps.

---

## 1. Determine Review Scope

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/resolve-base-branch .
```

Use the output as `BASE_BRANCH`.

**Diff range by argument:**

| Argument | `DIFF_RANGE` | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| (none) | `HEAD` | Uncommitted changes (staged + unstaged) vs last commit |
| `all` | `origin/[BASE_BRANCH]..` | All branch changes including uncommitted work |
| `last [N]` | `HEAD~[N]..HEAD` | Last N commits (committed only) |
| `[HASH]` | `[HASH]~1..[HASH]` | Single commit |

```bash
git diff $DIFF_RANGE --stat
```

**If no changes**: Report "No changes to review" and **END**.

### 1.1 Gather Decision Context

**Skip if** no `ISSUE_ID` extracted from branch.

```bash
.agents/skills/decider/scripts/decisions search --issue $ISSUE_ID
```

Collect decision IDs and summaries from JSON output.

The `path` fields in this JSON output are the ONLY authorized source for decision file paths in delegation guidance — the CLI resolves them from the decision index; never compose or recall a decision path from memory, however plausible the `DXXX-slug` looks (vstack#696). Verify every collected path before injecting it (belt-and-suspenders against index drift) — one simple command per path:

```bash
test -f [DECISION_FILE_PATH]
```

**If the check fails**: omit that path and carry the one-line note `- decision index lookup failed for [DECISION_ID]` in the `Decisions:` block instead — a broken path must never reach a reviewer.

## 2. Launch Review Agents

**Detect team context:**
```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state exists --json [ISSUE_ID]
```
```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state get [ISSUE_ID] '.team_name // empty'
```
Run each block as its own tool call. If state does not exist, use an empty `TEAM`.

**Determine agent list**:
```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/list-review-agents
```
Use the output as `AGENTS`.

**Resolve the reviewer slot budget** (same contract as `review-pr.md` § 2):
```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/orch-env REVIEWER_SLOT_BUDGET 0
```
`0` (default) = unlimited: delegate to every reviewer in one parallel batch. When the value is greater than zero and the `[AGENTS]` count exceeds the available slots (the budget minus this session minus live persistent agent sessions), run reviewers in sequential waves of up to the available slots: delegate a wave, wait for each reviewer's return, shut the completed session down to release its slot, then launch the next wave. If the value is `0` but the runtime still rejects a spawn with its thread-limit error, recover per `review-pr.md` § 2.2 persistent-mode thread-limit recovery: continue in sequential waves sized by the reviewers that did spawn and recommend the observed budget to the user. Review state lives in the returned report artifacts, never in reviewer session memory.

**Codex runtime agent type rule**: For each reviewer in `AGENTS`, first call the harness spawn API with `agent_type` equal to that reviewer name. The Codex `task_name` schema accepts only `[a-z0-9_]` and rejects hyphenated names before launch (vstack#751): pass the reviewer name with hyphens translated to underscores as the runtime `task_name` only (`reviewer-arch` → `task_name=reviewer_arch`, `agent_type` unchanged), and attempt that translation before any `worker` fallback — a `task_name` schema rejection is not a missing agent type. When the name was translated, record the runtime `task_name` under `review_agent_runtime_types[reviewer-name].task_name` if workflow state exists; state keys and reports always use the canonical hyphenated name. Do not launch `worker` and simulate reviewer identity in the prompt unless the generated-agent spawn was attempted and the spawn API rejects or does not expose that generated `agent_type`. In that fallback, spawn `agent_type=worker` but keep the logical reviewer name in bootstrap/delegation text, reports, and workflow-state keys. If workflow state exists, persist the returned id under `review_agent_ids[reviewer-name]`, and record runtime metadata under `review_agent_runtime_types[reviewer-name]` with `agent_type="worker"` and a fallback reason. Report the fallback in status.

Delegate to each review agent in parallel:

<delegation_format>
Follow workflow: .agents/skills/reviewer/workflows/review.md

Worktree: [WT_PATH]
Branch: [BRANCH]
Diff-range: [DIFF_RANGE]

Decisions:
[For each verified decision: "- [DECISION_ID]: [ONE_LINE_SUMMARY] — [DECISION_FILE_PATH]"]
[For each decision whose path failed verification: "- decision index lookup failed for [DECISION_ID]"]
[If none: "- No linked decisions found."]
</delegation_format>

## 3. Collect & Present Results

Wait for all review agents to complete. Unlimited-budget runs: do NOT shutdown — agents needed for potential fix delegation in § 4. Wave runs: completed reviewers are already shut down as each wave drains; their findings live in the report JSONs.

Extract `Report` path and `Verdict` from each agent's return. If any agent fails to return the expected format, halt and report error.

Overall verdict: `action_required` if any agent has blockers; `pass` otherwise.

**Update state** (if `ISSUE_ID` exists):
```bash
# For each agent JSON path:
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state append [ISSUE_ID] json_paths "[PATH]"
```

<output_format>

### CODE REVIEW COMPLETE

| Agent | Verdict | Path |
|-------|---------|------|
| **Overall** | `[pass\|action_required]` | |
| [For each agent:] |
| [AGENT] | `[verdict]` | `[path]` |
</output_format>

**Route by verdict + items:**

Read agent JSONs, check for items where `category == "fix"` or `category == "issue"`.

| verdict | items? | Next |
|---------|--------|------|
| any | yes (or `action_required`) | → § 4 |
| `pass` | none | → § 6 |

## 4. Present Review Items

**Collect items** from agent JSONs:
- **Blockers**: items from agents with `action_required` verdict
- **Fix suggestions**: items where `category == "fix"` from any agent
- **Issue suggestions**: items where `category == "issue"` from any agent

**If no items** → § 6.

**Present to user:**

<output_format>

### Review Items

**Blockers**

| # | Agent | Location | Description | Pri |
|---|-------|----------|-------------|-----|
| 1 | [agent] | [location] | [description] | 🔴 |

**Fix Suggestions**

| # | Agent | Location | Description | Pri | Est |
|---|-------|----------|-------------|-----|-----|
| 1 | [agent] | [location] | [description] | 🟤 | 1 |

**Issue Suggestions**

| # | Agent | Location | Description | Pri | Est |
|---|-------|----------|-------------|-----|-----|
| 1 | [agent] | [location] | [description] | 🟡 | 3 |

Pri: 🔴 P1  🟠 P2  🟡 P3  🟤 P4
Est: 1 (hours) | 2 (half-day) | 3 (day) | 4 (2-3d) | 5 (week+)

</output_format>

**Omit empty categories.**

Ask user (omit categories with no items):

| Category | Question | Type |
|----------|----------|------|
| Blockers + Fix suggestions | `Apply fixes?` | Multi-select: `#N: [TITLE]`, `All`, `None` |
| Issue suggestions | `Create issues for these?` | Multi-select: `#N: [TITLE]`, `All`, `None` |

| User Choice | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| Fix items selected | → § 4.1 (then § 5 with any issue selections) |
| Issue items only | → § 5 |
| No items selected | → § 6 |

### 4.1 Fix Delegation

**Never fix as main agent.**

1. **Capture pre-fix state** (if `ISSUE_ID` exists):
   ```bash
   .agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state set-git-head [ISSUE_ID] pre_delegate_sha [WORKTREE_PATH]
   ```

2. **Run Workflow**: `⤵ workflows/dev-fix.md § 1-3 → § 4.1 step 3` with context:
   - `worktree`: [WT_PATH]
   - `lifecycle`: `"managed"`
   - `dev_agent`: determine from state or labels (same as dev-fix standalone init)
   - `issue_id`: [ISSUE_ID] (if available)
   - `items`: [SELECTED_ITEMS — format each as `#[N] | [Agent] | [Location]` with Description + Recommendation]
   - `source`: `review`

3. **Present fix results** (state writes for fixed/escalated items are owned by `dev-fix.md` — do not re-append here):

   <output_format>

   ### Fix Results

   | # | Decision | Commit | Reasoning |
   |---|----------|--------|-----------|
   | N | Applied/Skipped/Blocked | [SHA] | [explanation] |

   </output_format>

→ § 5 (if issue items selected) or § 6

## 5. Create Issues

**Skip if** no issue suggestions selected AND no escalated items from § 4.1. → § 6

1. **Build audit-input file** from selected issue suggestions and escalated items per `.agents/skills/project-management/schemas/audit-issues-input.md`.
   - `source`: `"review"`
   - `parent_issue`: [ISSUE_ID] if available, else null
   - `worktree`: [WT_PATH]

2. **Write file**: `tmp/audit-review-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json`

3. **Run Workflow**: `⤵ .agents/skills/project-management/workflows/audit-issues.md --issues [FILE_PATH] § 1-9 → § 6`

## 6. Summary

**Shutdown review agents.** (Wave runs: already done per wave — nothing left to terminate.)

<output_format>

### ✅ REVIEW COMPLETE

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Scope | [DIFF_RANGE description — e.g., "12 files, 3 commits vs main"] |
| Agents | [N] |
| Blockers | [N] |
| Fixes applied | [N] |
| Issues created | [N] |
| Escalated | [N] |

</output_format>

**Omit zero-value rows** (except Scope and Agents).
