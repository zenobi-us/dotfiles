# Second Opinion

Cross-model code review and consultation via external AI CLI. Auto-detects your current harness and calls the opposite — Claude calls Codex, Codex calls Claude, Pi calls Claude.

## Prerequisites

- **jq** installed
- At least one external CLI: `claude` (Claude Code) or `codex` (Codex CLI)
- CLI must be authenticated (`claude /login` or `codex login`)

## Usage

As a slash command (natural language works):

```
/second-opinion review                     # Full branch diff
/second-opinion review last 3 commits      # Recent commits only
/second-opinion review uncommitted work     # Staged/unstaged changes
/second-opinion challenge my refactor plan  # Stress-test an approach
/second-opinion audit src/auth/             # Examine existing code
/second-opinion quick is this pattern safe? # Quick question
```

From the shell:

```bash
./scripts/second-opinion review --cwd .
./scripts/second-opinion detect
./scripts/second-opinion review --target claude --range HEAD~3..HEAD --cwd .
```

## Configuration

All optional — defaults work out of the box. Set shared, non-sensitive defaults in `vstack.settings.toml` under `[env]`. Existing `.env.local` values still work and should be reserved for personal overrides.

Project installs seed `vstack.settings.toml` from this skill's `vstack.settings.toml.example` when the file is missing, or merge any missing second-opinion keys into an existing file without overwriting user values.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `SECOND_OPINION_TARGET` | auto-detect | Force target: `claude` or `codex` |
| `SECOND_OPINION_TIMEOUT` | `300` | Max seconds to wait |
| `SECOND_OPINION_CLAUDE_CMD` | (see below) | Full command when calling Claude |
| `SECOND_OPINION_CODEX_CMD` | (see below) | Full command when calling Codex |

### Default commands

```bash
# When calling Claude (from Codex):
SECOND_OPINION_CLAUDE_CMD="claude -p --no-session-persistence --model opus --effort max --allowedTools Bash(read-only:true),Read,Glob,Grep"

# When calling Codex (from Claude):
SECOND_OPINION_CODEX_CMD="codex exec -m gpt-5.6-sol -s read-only -c model_reasoning_effort=xhigh --ephemeral"
```

Edit the full command string to change model, effort level, or tool access. No additional flags are appended.

### Flag reference

**Claude:**

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `-p` | Non-interactive print mode |
| `--no-session-persistence` | Ephemeral session |
| `--model opus` | Opus 4.6 (change to `sonnet` or `haiku` for speed/cost) |
| `--effort max` | Reasoning effort (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `max`) |
| `--allowedTools` | Tool access — read-only bash, file reads, search (no writes) |

**Codex:**

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `-m gpt-5.6-sol` | Model (change to any supported model) |
| `-s read-only` | Sandbox (`read-only`, `workspace-write`) |
| `-c model_reasoning_effort=xhigh` | Reasoning effort (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`) |
| `--ephemeral` | Ephemeral session |

## orch Integration

The orch skill's `review-pr` workflow optionally offers an external review at § 2.1. If accepted, the script produces review-finding JSON (same schema as internal review agents) that flows through the standard blocker/suggestion/issue pipeline.

The orch `submit-pr` workflow also runs `review` as a local pre-PR review of the branch diff (standalone lifecycle), draining bot-class findings at local speed instead of blocking on asynchronous GitHub review bots.

In `review` and `audit` modes the artifact's `timestamp` field is wrapper-stamped: after the model responds, the script overwrites `timestamp` with its own UTC wall clock (`date -u`), so the recorded time reflects when the wrapper wrote the file rather than a value the reviewing model serialized. Both orch workflows pass a delegated-at boundary to `review-artifact-check --file`, which rejects an artifact whose filesystem mtime predates that boundary — freshness never depends on a model-supplied timestamp.

`review` mode also derives its scope from the worktree before calling the external CLI: branch, diff range, diffstat, and changed-file list are embedded in the prompt. If the first response yields no parseable JSON — or parseable JSON missing the required `verdict`/`blockers`/`suggestions`/`questions` fields (a truncated extraction that silently lost the findings) — the one-shot retry resends the full original request (scope included) with the captured response, so the retry never runs context-free. An empty diff fails with exit 3 instead of producing an artifact; a response that self-reports no review was performed (`qa_metadata.review_performed: false`) or omits the required `qa_metadata` object is preserved as `<output>.noreview.json` and fails with exit 4; and a response still structurally incomplete after the retry is preserved as `<output>.incomplete.json` and fails with exit 4 — so a "pass" artifact always corresponds to a complete review that actually happened. `review-artifact-check` rejects self-reported no-review artifacts on its side too (reason `no_review`), and qa-shaped artifacts that lost their finding arrays (reason `incomplete`).
