# pi-agents-zellij — development notes

Implementation surface for contributors and AI callers. End-user setup, commands, customization, and settings live in [`README.md`](./README.md).

## Nomenclature

Three layers, used consistently across tool output, mini dashboard widget, full `/agents` popup, and the persisted record:

- **Agent** — the static profile (name, model, kind, deny-tools, description). Sources are `~/.claude/agents`, `~/.pi/agent/agents`, nearest project `.claude/agents`, and nearest project `.pi/agents`; `$HOME` harness dirs stay user-scoped when Pi runs under home. Reusable across many invocations.
- **Session** — the underlying Pi runtime carrying an agent. Has a `sessionId` and a session file (JSONL transcript) that survives across turns. Pane agents have ONE persistent session per pane; bg agents default to ONE-SHOT (fresh session per task) but can reuse a session via `sessionKey`.
- **Task** — a single `subagent` tool invocation. Has a `taskId`, the input prompt, status (`queued` → `working` → `completed | failed | needs_completion`), summary, transcript path, and usage. The unit of work the user observes.

Relationships:

- 1 agent → N sessions (over a project's lifetime). 1 session → M tasks. For pane agents `M >> 1`; for bg one-shot agents `M = 1` per session; for bg agents reusing a `sessionKey` lane `M >= 1`.
- A **prompt** is the input text of a task. A task is not just a prompt — it's the whole invocation record including lifecycle and result. The Monitor tab's `Task` subtab specifically shows the input prompt of a completed task.
- `taskId` is globally unique. `sessionId` is per-runtime. `agent.name` is the static identifier.

Session-mode fields on task records use normalized user-facing values:

- `sessionMode: "new"` — pane task that launched the first task on a fresh pane session.
- `sessionMode: "resumed"` — task continuing prior context: live/reopened pane, restored archived pane, or explicit bg `sessionKey` lane.
- `sessionMode: "fresh"` — independent bg one-shot with no user-supplied `sessionKey`.
- `sessionKey` is stored only for explicit bg memory lanes. Row chips render `lane:<key>` truncated to about 14 characters; Inspector Summary renders the full key.

Do not confuse normalized record `sessionMode` (`fresh|resumed|new`) with runtime-only pane `paneSessionMode` (`live|resumed|new`); `live` and `resumed` both normalize to `resumed`.

Where the UI surfaces each layer:

- **Mini dashboard widget** — one row per dispatched task (current state + usage rollup). Resumed pane work can share a row when transcript identity matches; task-centric detail surfaces expose individual `taskId`s. When a pane row is collapsed this way, registry sync keeps the newest task for that pane session so historical records from completion polling cannot temporarily rewind the row and reshuffle the completed list.
- **`/agents` popup → Agents tab** — agent profiles only: static frontmatter/config, source path, and system prompt. No task children, task ids, transcripts, completion summaries, or latest-message surfaces. The Inspector is intentionally static; execution data lives on Monitor.
- **`/agents` popup → Monitor tab** — session-grouped tree of active + completed tasks. Session is the primary grouping: pane, bg-lane (`sessionKey`), or bg-one-shot. Repeated same-agent sessions get session numbers; task numbers reset inside each session. Selecting a session shows aggregate metadata/usage/status counts; selecting a task shows Summary, Completion, and Task detail.
- **Tool output rendering** — per-task status rows (`● Agent <name> <status> · bg|pane · ctrl+o to expand`) with a `Task: <prompt>` body line when echoing the prompt and a JSON/markdown-aware preview when showing the result.

When reading code, prefer the layer names above over ambiguous terms like "run" or "invocation". `PaneTaskRecord` is per-task; `PaneSession*` types refer to the session runtime; `discoveredAgent` / `agentConfig` refer to the static profile.

## Subagent tool surface

The `subagent` Pi tool accepts single, parallel, and chain forms.

```json
// Single
{ "agent": "rust", "task": "Inspect error handling and summarize findings." }

// Parallel
{ "tasks": [
  { "agent": "iced", "task": "Review the widget layout." },
  { "agent": "reviewer-test", "task": "Check test coverage gaps." }
] }

// Chain (with {previous} placeholder)
{ "chain": [
  { "agent": "scout", "task": "Map the relevant files." },
  { "agent": "planner", "task": "Turn this into a plan: {previous}" }
] }
```

Options:

- `agentScope`: `project` (default), `user`, or `both`.
- `cwd`: per-task working directory.
- `confirmProjectAgents`: prompt before running project agents.
- `sessionKey`: opt-in named memory lane (bg agents). Pane agents persist via their own session file and ignore `sessionKey`. Parallel and chain items that omit `sessionKey` automatically get distinct one-shot lanes. Reused lanes run a preflight context-budget heuristic — see Settings → Execution.

Unknown agent names fail with a structured error listing missing and available agents. No similar-name redirect is attempted.

Live pane reuse checks Zellij `list-panes --json --command` metadata before returning an existing pane or writing a new inbox task. If Zellij reports a deleted, missing, or different `pane_cwd`, reuse fails with `stopReason: "pane-cwd-stale"`. Queue failures emit `subagents:failed` with `reason: "pane-cwd-stale"`, cwd details, and no task record because no task was queued; callers should `stop_subagent` and retry with `forceSpawn: true`.

Parallel dispatch runs through a flat worker pool capped by `maxConcurrency` (default 4); the whole task array shares one queue. The limit applies to concurrent one-shot/background executions. Persistent pane agents occupy a worker only until launch/enqueue, then completion tracking moves out of the pool. The earlier `maxParallelTasks` setting is a deprecated no-op kept for setting-file compatibility and is intentionally absent from the settings manager metadata.

Bg one-shot children complete through their final assistant output, which the runner captures from the JSON stream and publishes as the `subagents:completed` summary. They do not have a durable pane task outbox, so the runner filters `complete_subagent` out of inherited active tools, passes `--exclude-tools complete_subagent`, and falls back to `--no-tools` if that was the only inherited tool. Persistent pane and follow-up tasks remain the only paths that instruct children to call `complete_subagent`.

Child process environment is split by identity vs visible pane ownership. `PI_SUBAGENT_CHILD_AGENT` exists for both persistent pane children and bg one-shot children so statusline context and `delegate_subagent` authorization work everywhere. `PI_SUBAGENT_CHILD_PANE=1` is exported only by the persistent pane launcher; only that marker allows session-start code to set the zellij pane title or poll the pane inbox. The bg runner must delete inherited `PI_SUBAGENT_CHILD_PANE`, `PI_SUBAGENT_PARENT_SESSION_ID`, and `PI_BRIDGE_*` vars because bg children run inside the parent process tree and can inherit pane env from the master pane.

## Restricted delegation (`delegate_subagent`) — issue #228

`delegate_subagent` is a single-mode wrapper around the same dispatch helpers `subagent` uses (`runSingleDispatch` → `runSingleAgent`). Differences from `subagent`:

```json
// Only shape accepted. `cwd` is the sole optional field.
{ "agent": "scout", "task": "Map the cwd-snapshot module.", "cwd": "/optional/working/dir" }
```

`cwd` defaults to the caller's cwd when omitted; when present it is threaded to `runSingleDispatch` as `cwdOverride`, identical to the single-mode path of full `subagent`.

- **Authorization.** `PI_SUBAGENT_CHILD_AGENT` must be set in the calling Pi process. Pane launchers and the bg one-shot runner both export it for issue #228. Do not use it as proof that the process owns a zellij pane; use `PI_SUBAGENT_CHILD_PANE=1` for visible pane-only behavior. Without the agent identity var the tool refuses immediately. The caller agent's discovered `AgentConfig.allowedSubagents` (parsed from `allowed-subagents:` frontmatter and aliases `allowedSubagents` / `subagent-agents` / `subagent_agents`) is the canonical allowlist. Unlisted targets, undiscovered targets, and pane targets are all rejected before launch.
- **No orchestration knobs.** No `tasks`, `chain`, `agentScope`, `sessionKey`, `forceSpawn`, `resumeSession`, or `confirmProjectAgents`. The schema literally does not expose them; the resolver defaults `agentScope` to `"project"` and `sessionKey`/`forceSpawn`/`resumeSession` to undefined.
- **Tool inheritance.** Child tools start from the parent active tools then drop the target agent's `deny-tools`. vstack-generated reviewer/analyst/manager agents already deny `delegate_subagent` so a chain like `rust → scout → researcher` is impossible by default — scout's `allowed-subagents` is empty, and `delegate_subagent` is in scout's `deny-tools`. Both layers fail closed.
- **Bg-only.** Pane targets reject with a clear error; engineer-style delegation is intentionally disposable.
- **System prompt.** When the only active subagent surface is `delegate_subagent`, `before_agent_start` emits a short "Restricted Subagent Delegation" section listing the caller's allowlist (with model / pane warning) instead of the full Project Agents list. When `subagent` is also active (parent orchestrator), the full list is emitted unchanged.

vstack CLI defaults: engineer-role agents emit `allowed-subagents: scout` and omit `delegate_subagent` from `deny-tools`. Analyst/reviewer/manager agents omit `allowed-subagents` and add `delegate_subagent` to `deny-tools` so the child LLM never sees it. An explicit `allowed-subagents = []` in `vstack.toml` overrides the engineer default and re-denies the tool.

## One-shot transcript capture

Bg one-shot agents run Pi in JSON stream mode and write a sidecar transcript under `transcripts/<agent>/<taskId>.jsonl`. The writer records `start`, `exit`, `message_start`, `message_end`, tool execution events, stderr, parse errors, and diagnostics. It drops successful `message_update` events by default because those events are full message-so-far snapshots and duplicate the final `message_end` content. If the process exits nonzero or emits a process error after an unfinalized update, the latest filtered update is flushed as a `buffered: true` diagnostic record. Set `PI_AGENTS_ZELLIJ_TRANSCRIPT_FULL=1` in the parent environment before launching Pi to keep the full stream for debugging.

The writer also normalizes Pi event shapes used by current and older bridge streams (`{type:"event", event, data}`, `{event:{type}}`, and top-level `{type}`) before processing. `agent_start` transcript entries are enriched with the static agent name, selected model, and spawned Pi args (omitting the final task prompt arg) so transcript-only telemetry can attribute cost and model selection without reading the synthetic `start` row.

## Result retrieval and steering

```json
// Recovery fallback (pass wait: true to block the turn — use sparingly).
get_subagent_result { "taskId": "iced-..." }

// Idle wait without shell polling.
wait_for_subagent_idle { "agent": "iced", "timeoutMs": 30000 }
// or
get_subagent_result { "taskId": "iced-...", "waitFor": "idle" }

// Mid-run correction. Targets pi-session-bridge; falls back to queued steering note.
steer_subagent { "taskId": "iced-...", "message": "...", "deliverAs": "steer" }

// Kill the pane (preserves the session file; next launch resumes).
stop_subagent { "agent": "iced" }
```

`wait_for_subagent_idle` reports `idle-after-busy` only after observing the pane leave idle first; if it never becomes busy it returns `never-busy`.

Pane support tools are registered from `extensions/subagent/index.ts` through explicit dependency injection into `registerPaneSupportTools()`. Keep steer-path helpers such as `ensurePaneBridgeMetadata` wired in that registration object instead of importing pane helpers from `pane-support-tools.ts`; this keeps the support-tool module out of the pane/task import graph and prevents missing-helper regressions like `ensurePaneBridgeMetadata is not a function`.

## Needs-completion cwd snapshots

All `needs_completion` records try to include a `cwdSnapshot` when the worker cwd is known. Pane-mode marks use the pane registry cwd; bg compact-then-empty detection uses the bg worker cwd. Snapshot fields are `head` (validated 40-hex), `dirty` (from a filter-safe index/lstat snapshot), and `lastCommit.subject`.
Pane `markTaskNeedsCompletion` persists and returns the `needs_completion` record before kicking off cwd snapshot patching, so best-effort git timeouts cannot delay caller notification of the original failure.
`cwdSnapshot` reads are bounded and read-only: each git call has a 5s timeout, uses `GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0`, `--no-optional-locks`, `-c core.fsmonitor=false`, `-c core.untrackedCache=false`, `-c log.showSignature=false`, and a minimal Git env so snapshotting does not invoke repository fsmonitor/signature/filter helpers or write to the worker repo. Dirty-state collection avoids `git status` and uses index-vs-HEAD metadata, index lstat metadata, deleted-file listing, and untracked-file listing instead; the index-debug read has a larger bounded buffer than other git probes so the tracked-file scan can apply its file cap before Node maxBuffer handling. Tracked-file lstat scanning has a file cap and sub-second deadline, rejects unsafe index paths before probing, checks the deadline before each parent/final lstat, skips paths under symlinked parent directories before probing final-path metadata, and appends an incomplete-scan diagnostic when truncated, malformed, blocked by unsafe paths, blocked by symlinked parents, blocked by deadline expiry, or blocked by lstat errors.

## Compact-then-empty needs-completion detector

For vstack#38, bg subagent runs detect `session_compact → agent_end{content:[]}` or content with no `type:"text"` parts on the post-compact bridge-stream slice only. This emits `subagents:needs_completion` with `reason: "compact-then-empty"`.
The detector is mutually exclusive with the context-overflow throw-path retry from PR #35: retry logic handles thrown overflows first, and compact-then-empty only classifies attempts that did not trigger that retry path. Retry detection only trusts error envelopes/stderr; normal tool output or assistant text that mentions overflow strings must not trigger a retry. The text matcher follows Pi core overflow wording for OpenAI/Codex-style errors, including `context_length_exceeded`, `exceeds the context window`, and parenthesized `maximum context length (N)` messages.

## Bg one-shot timeout watchdog

For vstack#336, bg one-shot child processes have a hard deadline from `bgTaskTimeoutMs` (default 30 minutes; `0` disables). This covers the case where the child process wedges mid tool-use loop and never emits `agent_end` or exits, so pane/outbox watchdogs cannot run. When the deadline fires, `runner.ts` records `stopReason: "unresponsive_timeout"`, appends timeout diagnostics to the transcript/result, emits the normal `subagents:failed` lifecycle event, resolves the parent worker with a failed `SingleResult`, and sends `SIGTERM` followed by `SIGKILL` to the child process group. This lets the parallel worker pool continue and prevents orphaned bg children from lingering indefinitely.

## Agent-end watchdog (vstack#66)

Fallback for the silent-abandonment case where a child agent's turn ends — pane goes idle, transcript settles — but no `complete_subagent` outbox JSON was written. The existing child `agent_end` handler only synthesizes a needs_completion outbox when the task was inbox-delivered (`childCurrentTaskFile` is set); bridge-delivered follow-ups left the parent waiting forever.

Implementation: `extensions/subagent/agent-end-watchdog.ts` exposes `createAgentEndWatchdog(deps)`. On `agent_end`, the child also scans the task registry for active (`queued`/`running`/`unknown`) records belonging to its agent and schedules a watchdog check per task. After `VSTACK_AGENT_END_WATCHDOG_GRACE_SEC` (default 10s) the watchdog confirms the outbox is still missing, the task record is still active, and the pane is `ctx.isIdle()` before writing a synthetic outbox via `O_EXCL` open at `completionPath(runtimeRoot, agent, taskId)` with `status: "needs_completion"`, `reason: "turn-ended-without-complete-subagent"`, and `synthetic: true`. Successful synthesis also calls `markTaskNeedsCompletion`, so the parent's existing wake/poll path picks the outbox up unchanged.

Race safety: the default writer uses `fs.open(path, "wx")` so a real `complete_subagent` that races the watchdog always wins. Successive `agent_end` events for the same task are deduped by an in-process `fired` set; pending grace timers are deduped by a `pending` map. Failures are warn-logged, never thrown. Disable entirely with `VSTACK_AGENT_END_WATCHDOG=0`.

## Rate-limit watchdog (vstack#108 / #285)

Persistent pane children run `extensions/subagent/rate-limit-watchdog.ts` on assistant `message_end` events. Classification is deliberately narrow: the event must be an assistant message with `stopReason: "error"`, and only assistant `errorMessage` / text blocks are scanned. Accepted prose includes transient provider messages (`temporarily limiting requests`, `rate limited`, `429`, `too many requests`) and Claude Code session/usage caps (`You've hit your session limit`, `You've hit your usage limit`, `session limit`, `usage limit`, `· resets ...`). Non-assistant tool/user echoes and assistant success turns still emit `subagents:rate_limit_skipped` rather than scheduling recovery.

Retry timing flows through an import-free decision module plus a lazy provider-neutral quota seam. `rate-limit-decision.ts` stays self-contained so Pi 0.80.3's binary TS loader does not resolve a large dependency module through a `data:` URL at extension startup. Provider quota fetch/normalization lives in `rate-limit-quota.ts` and `rate-limit-quota-normalize.ts`; `rate-limit-watchdog.ts` imports that path only after a rate-limit event. Assistant prose is only the classifier/trigger. The schedule source order is: structured quota snapshot (`resetSource="usage-endpoint"`; Claude OAuth/web usage responses and Codex/OpenAI `wham/usage` shapes normalize into `QuotaSnapshot`), SDK `resetAt`/`resetsAt` or `retry_after*` (`resetSource="sdk-rate-limit-event"`), degraded localized prose reset parsing (`resetSource="prose-fallback"`), then plain ladder (`resetSource="backoff-only"`). Usage snapshots are fail-closed: transient or negated `not your usage limit` events only use saturated/limit-reached windows, malformed/unknown quota shapes fall back, and endpoint/schema failures warn with sanitized `quota-source-error` metadata. Activity payloads persist `reset_source`, `reset_at_ms`, and `degraded_reset_source` so stale wake-time decisions are debuggable. Codex CLI RPC is represented as a `cli-rpc` source seam but not spawned yet; implement it with bounded startup/per-method timeouts and token redaction before enabling.

## Dashboard widget internals

`alt+a` cycles the widget hidden → compact → expanded. `alt+shift+a` / `f3` opens the full `/agents` popup.

Each row shows agent name, kind (`pane`/`bg`), turn count, input/output tokens, cost, and (for working agents) a live tail of the latest tool/message truncated to card width.

Rows are bucketed for stability: queued/running/waiting agents stay above attention states; attention stays above completed. Within each bucket, rows preserve start-time order so token/usage updates do not reshuffle the list. The header always shows completed and working counts even when one side is zero. Missing pane artifacts render as `stale`; stale bg-only records are dropped (bg agents do not use pane handoff files).

The popup has two top-level tabs: **Agents** (scoped project/user agent profiles, static Inspector only) and **Monitor** (session-grouped execution tree). Monitor groups task records by pane session, explicit bg lane, or bg one-shot under expandable Active and Completed sections. Session rows show parent metadata (agent, session type/number/mode, model, effort, aggregate usage, session artifacts); task rows keep Summary/Completion detail: Summary holds task-local metadata, task artifacts, and task text; Completion holds returned result summary, files changed, validation, notes, and optional completion JSON. Repeated same-agent sessions show `session #N` in session detail, and task rows show `Task #N` within that session only. `#1` is always suppressed across mini widget, chat attribution, Monitor task rows, and trace Summary; numbers only appear from the second task per agent/session onward, so a lone task reads as plain `<agent>` / `Task <time>` instead of `<agent> #1` / `Task #1 · <time>`. Agents rows are flat and do not expose task children, transcripts, or task-scoped summaries; they may show a live-pane dot only as a pointer that execution state exists on Monitor.

Compaction events are not rendered in the Monitor popup. The transcript parser still recognizes the same `session_compact` bridge-stream shape used by the compact-then-empty detector (PR #46 / issue #38), plus compatibility variants like `{ event: "compact" }` and `message.customType: "session-compact"`, for callers that open raw trace views.

Popup browser internals are split by concern:

- `browser.ts` owns modal lifecycle, input dispatch, top-level tab layout, and re-exports the public surface used by tests and sibling modules.
- `browser/shared.ts` holds popup frame, key, modal-lock, tab strip, layout, and the cancel-input fallback.
- `browser/agents-tab.ts` builds agent rows and renders the static Inspector pane (including the system-prompt viewport).
- `browser/monitor-tree.ts` derives Monitor session groups, session/task tree rows, selection clamping, and the left tree renderer.
- `browser/monitor-session-detail.ts` renders the right-pane Detail when a session row is selected (aggregate metadata, usage, task list).
- `browser/monitor-task-detail.ts` renders the right-pane Detail when a task row is selected, plus the shared trace tab bar, line highlighter, and `traceViewerItems` builder.
- `browser/frontmatter-editor.ts` owns YAML/TOML parse + upsert for agent overrides, the modal editor flow, and the post-edit confirmation popup.
- `browser/dashboard-integration.ts` bridges task records into dashboard labels and synthesizes bg chat delegation/completion rows.
- `browser/trace-viewer.ts` owns the standalone trace popup invoked from `/agents` slash commands.
- `task-records.ts` provides neutral task numbering, session-key derivation, active/terminal status checks, usage roll-up, and a sync registry reader. Dashboard and Monitor share this without going through `browser.ts`.

`highlightInlinePreview` in `format.ts` is the shared inline JSON / status-token highlighter used by dashboard previews and tool output. After the round-2 fix it tokenizes in two passes: highlight JSON keys (`"name":`) first, replace each colored span with a placeholder sentinel before running the status-value passes (`approve` / `failed` / etc), and restore the key spans afterwards. This prevents malformed or truncated JSON from re-coloring inside an already-styled key span, which otherwise produced nested ANSI escapes and wrong-color output. Empty message content renders an `(empty)` placeholder rather than a blank row, and an empty leading user prompt does not consume the task-text fallback.

Completed task records store the durable result summary in `PaneTaskRecord.summary`. On restore, completed records with a transcript but no summary backfill from the last assistant text in the transcript. Dashboard rows, Monitor Summary, Chat completion rows, and `get_subagent_result` all read that same field; if no real summary exists they show `completion summary unavailable; see transcript` instead of echoing the original task prompt.

## Activity broker publication

When `pi-session-bridge` has installed `globalThis[Symbol.for("vstack.pi.activity")]`, subagent lifecycle notifications publish best-effort `agent.*` broker events. Internal `subagents:created`, `queued`, `started`, `steered`, `needs_completion`, `completed`, and `failed` signals map to `agent.spawned`, `agent.task_queued`, `agent.task_started`, `agent.steered`, `agent.needs_completion`, `agent.empty_after_compact`, `agent.task_completed`, `agent.task_blocked`, `agent.task_failed`, and `agent.pane_cwd_stale`. Refs carry `task_id` and `agent`; details include session mode/key, pane id, transcript/completion paths, model/effort, reason/status, pane-cwd-stale cwd fields, and `cwdSnapshot` when present.

Broker publication is isolated in `extensions/subagent/activity.ts` and must stay fail-open: activity publisher errors do not affect task dispatch, completion, steering, or result retrieval.

## Browser keys

- `tab` / `shift+tab` switches between **Agents** and **Monitor**.
- `↑/↓`, `-/=`, `home/end` navigate. `←/→` switches tree/detail focus and cycles task-detail subtabs. `enter` expands/collapses Monitor Active/Completed/session rows or opens task detail.
- `enter` inserts `Use agent <name> to: ` into the editor.
- `alt+g` edits the selected agent's frontmatter.
- Pane agents: `alt+p`/`ctrl+p` start or reuse, `alt+o`/`ctrl+o` attach, `alt+x`/`ctrl+x` stop.
- `esc` closes.

Status legend per row: live pane, startable, stale, background. Dashboard rows: queued, working, completed, needs completion, failed/blocked.

## Pane registry mechanics

Pane registries and task records are stored in sidecar files and mirrored into session custom entries only when the snapshot changes AND the session file's on-disk leaf still matches the active in-memory leaf. This prevents duplicate / orphaned Pi processes from advancing an older branch and making `/resume` land before the latest visible turns.

Registry writes use `withCrossProcessFileLock()` so parent sessions and child panes do not interleave JSON writes. The default lock timeout must stay longer than the stale-lock window so a killed process's lock can be reaped before callers give up. Dashboard and Monitor refreshes are best-effort: if task diagnostics cannot update a record because another process holds the registry lock, they keep rendering the last known record and retry on the next poll instead of terminating Pi. Completion collection persists the terminal task record before archiving or deduping the outbox file; when terminal or archive-path persistence hits lock contention, the outbox stays in place or is restored as the retry source.

### Bounded session-state snapshots (vstack#177)

`persistRuntimeSnapshot()` enforces two guards on the `vstack-subagents:runtime-state` JSONL entry:

1. **Fingerprint dedup.** A stable hash of `{ panes, tasks }` (excluding `updatedAt`) per Pi session id; identical successive snapshots short-circuit before touching the session file.
2. **Size cap.** Default 64 KiB (`BOUNDED_SNAPSHOT_DEFAULT_MAX_BYTES`). Oversized payloads are replaced by a tiny manifest (`version: 2, fullSnapshot: false, reason: "payload-too-large", byteSize, fingerprint, counts, updatedAt`). The full registry stays on disk in `taskRegistryPath` and `paneRegistryPath`; restore continues to read those sidecars first and ignores manifest entries via `isPersistedSubagentRuntimeState`. Without this guard, a long-lived session with ~200 completed tasks accumulated ~1 GB of `vstack-subagents:runtime-state` JSONL entries and crashed `/resume` with a V8 OOM.
