# Ralph Wiggum - Long-Running Development Loops

Use the `ralph_start` tool to begin a loop:

```
ralph_start({
  name: "loop-name",
  taskContent: "# Task\n\n## Goals\n- Goal 1\n\n## Checklist\n- [ ] Item 1\n- [ ] Item 2",
  maxIterations: 50,        // Default: 50
  itemsPerIteration: 3,     // Optional: suggest N items per turn
  reflectEvery: 10          // Optional: reflect every N iterations
})
```

## Loop Behavior

1. **Write the task file**: Create `.ralph/<name>.md` with the task content. The tool does NOT create this file—you must write it yourself using the Write tool.
2. Work on the task and update the file each iteration.
3. Record verification evidence (commands run, file paths, outputs) in the task file.
4. Call `ralph_done` to proceed to the next iteration.
5. Output `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` when finished.
6. Stop when complete or when max iterations is reached (default 50).

## User Commands

- `/ralph start <name|path>` - Start a new loop.
- `/ralph resume <name>` - Resume loop.
- `/ralph stop` - Pause loop (when agent idle).
- `/ralph-stop` - Stop active loop (idle only).
- `/ralph status` - Show loops.
- `/ralph list --archived` - Show archived loops.
- `/ralph archive <name>` - Move loop to archive.
- `/ralph clean [--all]` - Clean completed loops.
- `/ralph cancel <name>` - Delete loop.
- `/ralph nuke [--yes]` - Delete all .ralph data.

Press ESC to interrupt streaming, send a normal message to resume, and run `/ralph-stop` when idle to end the loop.

## Task File Format

```markdown
# Task Title

Brief description.

## Goals
- Goal 1
- Goal 2

## Checklist
- [ ] Item 1
- [ ] Item 2
- [x] Completed item

## Verification
- Evidence, commands run, or file paths

## Notes
(Update with progress, decisions, blockers)
```

## Best Practices

1. Write a clear checklist with discrete items.
2. Update checklist and notes as you go.
3. Capture verification evidence for completed items.
4. Reflect when stuck to reassess approach.
5. Output the completion marker only when truly done.
