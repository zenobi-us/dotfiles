Run shell commands in the background without blocking the conversation.

## Highlights

- `bg_task` spawns, lists, tails, stops, and clears background commands.
- `/bg` opens an interactive dashboard with task logs, details, and controls.
- `/bg:next` or the shortcut sends the next bash command to the background.
- Blocking monitors (`watch`, `tail -f`, `journalctl -f`, polling loops) auto-background before they freeze the turn.
- Exit and output-match wakeups bring the agent back when work finishes or important text appears.
- Optional resource controls lower CPU/I/O priority via `systemd-run` or `nice`/`ionice` fallback.
- Full logs stay on disk even when chat/tool output is truncated.
- Session sidecar state restores task history across reloads and resumes.
- Inline mini-dashboard shows live task state; full dashboard handles larger fleets without bloating chat history.
- `pi-session-bridge` can publish structured `bg_task.*` activity events as a side channel, not chat messages.

## Install

Via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vanillagreen/pi-background-tasks):

```bash
pi install npm:@vanillagreen/pi-background-tasks
```

Via [vstack](https://github.com/vanillagreencom/vstack):

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/vanillagreencom/vstack.git vstack
vstack add vanillagreencom/vstack --pi-extension pi-background-tasks --harness pi -y
```

Restart Pi after installation.

## Commands

| Command | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `/bg` | Open the dashboard. |
| `/bg:next` | Arm the next bash command for backgrounding. |
| `/bg:run <command>` | Spawn a background shell task. |
| `/bg:list` | Show tracked tasks. |
| `/bg log <id\|pid>` | Show a task log tail. |
| `/bg watch <id\|pid>` | Open the dashboard focused on a task. |
| `/bg:stop <id\|pid>` | Terminate a running task. |
| `/bg:clear` | Remove finished tasks. |

Arguments support autocomplete, including task IDs.

## Auto-background

Bash commands matching obvious monitor patterns are intercepted before they start and run as a background task instead. The foreground bash tool returns a short acknowledgement with the task id, PID, and log path so the agent turn keeps moving.

Built-in matches: `watch ...`, `tail -f`, `journalctl -f`, Pi-bridge/tmux polling loops, and shell loops with `sleep` that monitor session state.

Use the arm-next-bash shortcut or `/bg:next` to force the next bash command into the background even if it doesn't match the built-in patterns. Only applies to commands not yet started.

## Settings

Open `/extensions:settings`; settings appear under the **Background Tasks** tab.

Project settings in `.pi/settings.json` apply only after Pi marks the workspace trusted; before trust, vstack Pi extensions read user/global settings only.

Glyph style: each package exposes `glyphStyle` (`unicode` default, `ascii` for terminal-safe chrome). `@vanillagreen/pi-tool-renderer.globalGlyphStyleOverride=ascii` forces ASCII chrome across vstack Pi extensions while leaving tool/model/user content unchanged.

### Execution

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Enable background tasks | Master toggle for `bg_task`, auto-backgrounding, and the widget. |
| Default timeout | Spawn timeout. `0` disables. |
| Auto-background blocking bash monitors | Auto-divert long-running bash commands into `bg_task`. |
| Extra auto-background patterns | Newline-separated regexes for project-specific monitors. |
| Shortcut arming window | Seconds the arm-next-bash shortcut / `/bg:next` stays armed. |
| Force-kill grace | Milliseconds between SIGTERM and SIGKILL. |
| Resource controls | Opt-in lower-priority execution for spawned background tasks. Off by default; when off, spawn/stop behavior is unchanged. |
| Resource control mode | `auto` prefers a probed `systemd-run --user` transient service on Linux, then `nice`/`ionice` fallback. `systemd-run`, `nice-ionice`, and `off` force one path. |
| Apply controls to bg_task | Apply controls to explicit `bg_task` and `/bg:run` spawns. |
| Apply controls to auto-backgrounded bash | Apply controls to bash commands diverted by auto-backgrounding, `/bg next`, or the arm-next-bash shortcut. |
| CPU weight / I/O weight | `systemd-run` `CPUWeight=` / `IOWeight=` values (1-10000). Lower values yield resources. Defaults are 100. |
| Nice value | `systemd-run` `Nice=` and `nice` fallback value (-20 to 19). Default 10 lowers CPU priority. |
| ionice class / level | `systemd-run` `IOSchedulingClass=` / `IOSchedulingPriority=` and `ionice` fallback. Default best-effort level 7 lowers I/O priority. |
| Warn on resource-control fallback | Show at most one warning/diagnostic when configured controls fall back or no-op because helpers are unavailable. |

### Wakeups

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Shortcut output wakeups | Wake the agent on new output from shortcut-forced tasks. |
| Output settle delay | Debounce before output wakeups fire. |

### Output

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| In-memory output buffer | Per-task in-memory cap. Logs always keep full output. |
| Wakeup output tail | Characters included in output/exit wakeup messages. Default 2000; wakes are steer messages that bypass `pi-output-policy`, so this is the per-wake transcript budget. Raise only for monitors whose verbose inline tail is genuinely useful. |
| Dashboard/log tail | Characters shown in dashboard and log actions. Default 10000; truncated tool output points at the full log file. |
| Output wake budget (count) | Maximum output wakes per task before further output wakes are suppressed and a single "wake budget exhausted; inspect log" notice is emitted. Set 0 to disable. Exit wakes are unaffected. |
| Output wake budget (bytes) | Cumulative inline output-tail bytes per task before output wakes are suppressed. Set 0 to disable. |

### UI

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Show task widget | Compact background-task widget. Manual hide wins over task lifecycle refreshes until you toggle it back in. |
| Widget placement | Above or below the editor. |
| Tool output style | `compact` one-liner or `stacked` rows with expandable details. |
| Expanded tool log lines | Maximum lines shown when expanding log output. |
| Dashboard output line cap | Maximum lines in the interactive dashboard viewport. |
| Mini-dashboard default mode | `compact`, `expanded`, or `hidden` at session start; runtime hide/show is user-controlled for the rest of the session. |
| Mini-dashboard finished retention | Seconds finished tasks stay visible in the inline widget. |
| Background next bash shortcut | Configurable. |
| Mini-dashboard toggle shortcut | Configurable show/hide toggle; toggling back in restores the last visible mode. |
| Dashboard shortcut | Configurable. |

### Storage

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Task log directory | Override log file location. `PI_BG_TASK_DIR` env var still wins. |

### Diagnostics

Routine wake/persistence diagnostics are written only when `PI_BG_TASK_DEBUG=1`, `PI_BG_TASK_DIAGNOSTICS=1`, or `PI_BG_TASK_DIAGNOSTIC_LOG=/path/to/log` is set. They go to a log file (default: `$TMPDIR/vstack-pi-bg/diagnostics.log`) instead of stdout/stderr so active TUI widgets cannot be corrupted by raw terminal output.

## Notes

Tasks are scoped to the current Pi runtime and stopped on session shutdown. Shells start in their own process group so `/bg:stop` and shutdown terminate children. Tasks inherit Pi's environment and working directory. Resource controls are disabled by default; when enabled, `systemd-run` tasks persist their transient service unit so `/bg:stop`, timeouts, and shutdown stop the actual workload, not just the wrapper process.

Exit wakeups are durable across session restarts and PID reuse — if a task ends while Pi is gone, the next session replays the missed wake. Output wakes scheduled before `stop` / `clear` are voided.

Output wakeups are transcript-budget-safe by default: each wake carries one ~2 KB tail (`outputAlertMaxChars`) plus a compact task manifest with truncated command/title/cwd, a chatty task is capped to 20 output wakes / 20 KB cumulative inline bytes before further wakes are suppressed (`outputWakeBudgetMaxWakes` / `outputWakeBudgetMaxBytes`), and unset `notifyMode` defaults to `transition` (or `first-match-only` when `notifyPattern` is set) so identical poller output does not wake the agent repeatedly. Output wakes and the budget-exhausted notice are delivered as `steer` messages, exit wakes as `followUp` so terminal status arrives in the next-turn delivery slot. Set `notifyMode: "always"` and/or raise the wake budget when you really do want every-update wakes.

Activity broker publication is best-effort and requires `pi-session-bridge` in the same Pi runtime. Broker events are side-channel `vstack_activity` stream rows, not chat messages.

See [`DEVELOPMENT.md`](./DEVELOPMENT.md) for the `bg_task` tool surface, wake-metadata schema, activity broker mapping, and orphan/PID-reuse identity probe.
