# pi-questions

![Questions workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanillagreencom/vstack/main/pi-extensions/pi-questions/assets/questions-workflow.gif)

Structured inline questions for Pi. Multi-tab categories, built-in free-text fallback answers, and bridge-driven replies.

## Highlights

- `question` tool for multiple-choice question tabs with a bottom `Something else` free-text fallback row by default.
- Editor-area UI by default; optional floating overlay.
- OpenCode-style question UI: tab hints and highlighted active rows.
- Compact answered tool output lists every category answer and expands inline to show each question with the selected choice marked.
- Wrapped option labels stay readable in narrow panes.
- `pi-session-bridge` integration lets external clients list, answer, and reject pending questions.
- When the bridge is loaded, question opened/answered/rejected lifecycle points publish structured `question.*` activity broker events without adding chat messages.
- `pi-qol` notification hook fires before prompts open.

## Install

Via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vanillagreen/pi-questions):

```bash
pi install npm:@vanillagreen/pi-questions
```

Via [vstack](https://github.com/vanillagreencom/vstack):

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/vanillagreencom/vstack.git vstack
vstack add vanillagreencom/vstack --pi-extension pi-questions --harness pi -y
```

Restart Pi after installation.

## Payload

```json
{
  "id": "que_example",
  "header": "Choose next action",
  "questions": [
    {
      "header": "Issue Missing",
      "question": "How should I proceed?",
      "options": [
        { "label": "Use current branch", "description": "Continue without a tracker issue." },
        { "label": "Stop here", "description": "Wait for operator guidance." }
      ],
      "multiple": false,
      "customLabel": "Something else"
    }
  ]
}
```

Result:

```json
{ "requestId": "que_example", "answers": [["Stop here"]] }
```

Cancelled:

```json
{ "requestId": "que_example", "cancelled": true }
```

Every tab includes a bottom free-text fallback row by default, labelled `Something else` unless `customLabel` overrides it. Agents no longer need to set `allowCustom` for a basic escape hatch; the legacy flag is still accepted for compatibility, and `allowCustom: false` does not disable the fallback. `customPlaceholder` customizes the input hint.

When the user types fallback text, the result uses the same answer shape as fixed options:

```json
{ "requestId": "que_example", "answers": [["Use issue ABC-123 instead"]] }
```

Do not include a final `Confirm`, `Submit`, `Review`, or `Done` question tab in the payload; the UI adds its own submit tab when needed.

## Settings

Open `/extensions:settings`; settings appear under the **Questions** tab.

Project settings in `.pi/settings.json` apply only after Pi marks the workspace trusted; before trust, vstack Pi extensions read user/global settings only.

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Question UI mode | `editor` replaces the input area; `overlay` uses a floating popup. |
| Overlay popup width | Overlay mode only. |
| Overlay popup max height | Overlay mode only. Number or percentage string. |
| Visible option rows | Rows shown before scrolling. |
| Default question header | Fallback title when a request has no header. |
| Bridge replies enabled | Allow `pi-session-bridge` to answer/reject pending questions. |

Glyph style: each package exposes `glyphStyle` (`unicode` default, `ascii` for terminal-safe chrome). `@vanillagreen/pi-tool-renderer.globalGlyphStyleOverride=ascii` forces ASCII chrome across vstack Pi extensions while leaving tool/model/user content unchanged.

## Bridge control

Requires `pi-session-bridge`. From any shell:

```bash
pi-bridge questions
pi-bridge answer --request-id que_example --answers '[["Stop here"]]'
pi-bridge reject --request-id que_example
```
