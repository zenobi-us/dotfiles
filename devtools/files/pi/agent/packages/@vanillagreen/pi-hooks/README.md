# @vanillagreen/pi-hooks

![pi-hooks settings panel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanillagreencom/vstack/main/pi-extensions/pi-hooks/assets/hooks-settings.png)

First-class Pi port of the vstack safety hooks. Each hook is independently toggleable.

## Hooks

| Hook | Pi event | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Block bare `cd` | `tool_call` (bash) | Blocks bare `cd /path` commands with no subshell or chaining. Use `(cd /path && command)` instead. |
| Pre-commit fmt + clippy | `tool_call` (bash) | When `git commit` targets the active project repo, runs `cargo fmt --check` then `cargo clippy` in async child processes so Pi stays responsive. Blocks on failure. Skips commits targeting other repos and only fires when `.rs` files are staged or modified; if the bash command contains `git add`, untracked `.rs` files are treated conservatively as possibly staged by that command. |
| Post-edit clippy | `tool_result` (edit/write of `.rs`) | Runs workspace clippy after `.rs` edits and appends issues mentioning the edited file. Advisory only — doesn't undo the edit. |
| End-of-turn clippy | `turn_end` | If `.rs` files were touched during the turn, runs workspace clippy and surfaces errors via UI notification. Advisory only. |

These implement the same safety goals as the bash hooks in `vstack/hooks/`, with Pi-specific mechanics where the in-process event loop needs different handling. In particular, the Pi pre-commit hook runs cargo checks via async child processes and first proves the commit targets the active project repo so unrelated fixture commits do not freeze the session. Any change to a hook script must land alongside the matching change in `pi-hooks` — see [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md).

## Install

```bash
vstack add --pi-extension pi-hooks
```

Or as part of `vstack add --all`. Refresh with `vstack refresh`.

Via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vanillagreen/pi-hooks):

```bash
pi install npm:@vanillagreen/pi-hooks
```

## Settings

Open `/extensions:settings`; settings appear under the **Hooks** tab.

Project settings in `.pi/settings.json` apply only after Pi marks the workspace trusted; before trust, vstack Pi extensions read user/global settings only.

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Enable hooks | Master toggle. Disable to make the extension inert without uninstalling. |
| Block bare cd | Toggle the bare-cd block hook. |
| Pre-commit fmt + clippy | Toggle the pre-commit hook. |
| Post-edit clippy | Toggle the post-edit advisory hook. |
| End-of-turn clippy | Toggle the end-of-turn advisory hook. |
| Clippy timeout | Max ms per clippy invocation. Advisory post-edit/end-of-turn clippy timeouts are abandoned so work can continue; blocking pre-commit fmt/clippy timeouts block the commit with a timeout reason. Pre-commit checks run asynchronously, so long checks may delay the commit gate without freezing the Pi TUI or bridge. |
