![Edit tool with side-by-side diff renderer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanillagreencom/vstack/main/pi-extensions/pi-tool-renderer/assets/edit-diff.png)

Compact renderers for Pi tools. Optional `tool_batch` composite tool. Optional rich diff UI for edits, writes, and bash patches.

## Highlights

- Compact one-line tool rows for `read`, `bash`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`; file paths in compact rows use OSC 8 `file://` hyperlinks when the terminal supports them.
- Delayed live bash tails avoid fast-command output flashes; long-running commands show/preserve the last few lines flush-left so copied output has no gutter characters.
- `tool_batch` runs multiple independent read/search/list/diagnostic bash calls and renders one combined result.
- Optional rich Shiki diffs for `edit`/`write` with side-by-side previews, hunk counts, and inline word highlights.
- Compact user-message cards with a green border and red π marker.
- Compaction summaries and skill invocations render with the same compact chrome.
- Generic renderers for OpenAI-style tools (`web_search`, `webfetch`, `Agent`, `Task*`) and MCP tools.
- `apply_patch` call/result preview when the tool is present.

Defaults leave `edit`/`write` on Pi's built-in renderers. Enable **Render edits/writes compactly** to opt in.

## Install

Via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vanillagreen/pi-tool-renderer):

```bash
pi install npm:@vanillagreen/pi-tool-renderer
```

Via [vstack](https://github.com/vanillagreencom/vstack):

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/vanillagreencom/vstack.git vstack
vstack add vanillagreencom/vstack --pi-extension pi-tool-renderer --harness pi -y
```

Restart Pi after installation.

## `tool_batch`

```json
{
  "calls": [
    { "tool": "read", "path": "README.md" },
    { "tool": "grep", "pattern": "registerCommand", "path": "pi-extensions" }
  ]
}
```

Accepts `read`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`, and diagnostic `bash`. Per-call arguments can be flat or wrapped in `args`.

Prefer it for independent inspection calls. **Don't** use it for mutating commands, order-dependent commands, streaming output, or anything you want to inspect separately.

If the combined output would exceed Pi's normal tool-result budget, child outputs are capped to fit (head + tail preserved). Use separate calls or `read` `offset`/`limit` for the full budget per call.

## Settings

Open `/extensions:settings`; settings appear under the **Tool Renderer** tab.

Project settings in `.pi/settings.json` apply only after Pi marks the workspace trusted; before trust, vstack Pi extensions read user/global settings only.

Glyph style: each package exposes `glyphStyle` (`unicode` default, `ascii` for terminal-safe chrome). `@vanillagreen/pi-tool-renderer.globalGlyphStyleOverride=ascii` forces ASCII chrome across vstack Pi extensions while leaving tool/model/user content unchanged.

### General

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Enable compact renderers | Override built-in read/bash/search renderers. |
| Tree connector style | `unicode` or `ascii`. |
| Stack separate native tool calls | Legacy renderer for consecutive native tool calls. Prefer `tool_batch`. |
| Stack child display | `rows`, `headline`, or `anchor-list` when stacking is on. |

### Batch tool

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Register tool_batch | Add the composite tool. |
| Batch max calls | Max calls per `tool_batch` invocation. |
| Batch per-call timeout (ms) | Max time any one child call may run before `tool_batch` reports that child as timed out. |

### Messages

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Compact user messages | Green border + red π marker instead of filled background; preserves Pi's prompt-zone markers around the full framed card. |
| User message trailing blank line | Extra blank line after user messages. |
| Compact compaction summaries | Compact bullet style instead of Pi's padded box. |
| Compact skill invocation messages | Compact `/skill:name` rows. |
| Align assistant messages | Remove Pi's one-column left padding from assistant text. |
| Styled markdown code blocks | Render fenced code blocks with syntax highlighting and background, flush-left with no copy gutter/prefix. |

### Read / Search / Bash output

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Read output mode | `preview`, `summary`, or `hidden`. |
| Search output mode | `preview`, `count`, or `hidden`. |
| Bash output mode | `opencode`, `preview`, `summary`, or `hidden`. |
| Live bash output delay (ms) | Wait this long before showing a running bash output tail. |
| Live bash tail lines | Tail lines shown for long-running bash output and kept after completion. |
| Expanded read/search/bash preview lines | Per-tool expand-time line caps. |
| Command preview characters | Max command chars in collapsed bash rows. |
| Collapsed bash preview lines | Tail lines shown when `bashOutputMode=preview`. |

### Bash diffs

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Render bash diffs | Detect diff output from read-only bash and render rich diff UI. Off by default. |
| Render git diff command diffs | Show rich diff UI for explicit `git diff` commands. Off by default. |

### Mutation (edit/write)

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Render edits/writes compactly | Override Pi's built-in edit/write renderers. Off by default. |
| Split diff view | Side-by-side rich diffs on wide terminals. |
| Collapsed / expanded diff preview lines | Line budgets for collapsed and expanded rows. |
| Edit/write call preview | Show safe call-phase diff previews before execution completes. |
| Edit/write call preview lines | Line budget for call-phase previews. |
| Syntax-highlight diffs | Use Shiki when a language can be detected. |
| Inline word diff highlights | Highlight changed words in paired removed/added lines. |
| Diff line backgrounds | Fill added/removed lines with success/error backgrounds. |
| Show diff hunk metadata | Include hunk counts and truncation hints. |

### Generic tools

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Generic external tool renderers | Render `web_search`, `webfetch`, `Agent`, `Task*` and similar. |
| Render apply_patch | Install `apply_patch` call/result renderers without changing execution. |
| apply_patch call preview | Parse arguments and render diff previews during the call phase. |
| apply_patch preview lines | Line budget for collapsed `apply_patch` diffs. |
| MCP output mode | `preview`, `summary`, or `hidden`. |
| MCP preview lines | Line budget for MCP/generic tool previews. |

### Chrome

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Global tool chrome | `off`, `transparent`, or `outlines` (muted horizontal rules above/below), including tools that render their own shell. |
| Guard terminal right margin | Render one column short to avoid auto-wrap flashes in tmux. |
| Animate pending tool status | Blink pending bullets. Off for stable streaming. |
| Working indicator | `default`, `pulse`, or `hidden`. |

### Safety

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Max renderer line width | Hard cap for single rendered lines. |

## Notes

This package mostly changes rendering, not tool execution. `tool_batch` is one tool result, so it caps combined child output if needed; individual built-in tools still apply their own truncation first.
