# QA Review Lifecycle

**The workflow for QA agents — project-configured QA specialists invoked via `needs-*` labels.**

QA agents are review-only. They are never assigned as issue owners.

**Ownership**: You review ONE PR. Return verdict to orchestrator. No issue tracker state changes.

---

## 1. Set Up

### 1.1 Resolve Tracker

Resolve tracker context once, before any tracker command. Every later tracker-specific read routes through it. Precedence:

1. **Delegation context**: an explicit `Tracker:` value in the delegation prompt (with `[OWNER/REPO]` for `github`).
2. **Inference fallback**: `[ISSUE_ID]` starting with `issue-` → `github`; otherwise `linear`. The GitHub issue number `[N]` is `[ISSUE_ID]` without the `issue-` prefix (orch key normalization). For `github` with no repository value, resolve it in the worktree:

   ```bash
   gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq .nameWithOwner
   ```

Store the result as `TRACKER`, plus `[OWNER/REPO]` when `TRACKER=github`.

**GitHub reviews must not run Linear commands**: when `TRACKER=github`, no `sync`, Linear cache read, or Linear mutation may run anywhere in this workflow. A missing Linear cache is not an error for a GitHub-tracked review — read live GitHub context instead (§ 1.2). If a tracker read fails on the resolved route, report the gap in your review output; do not silently fall back to the other tracker.

### 1.2 Read Context

**Linear route (TRACKER=linear)**:

```bash
.agents/skills/linear/scripts/linear.sh cache issues get [ISSUE_ID]
.agents/skills/linear/scripts/linear.sh cache comments list [ISSUE_ID]
```

**GitHub route (TRACKER=github)** — read the live issue body and comments in one command:

```bash
gh issue view [N] --repo [OWNER/REPO] --json number,title,body,comments,labels,url
```

Extract from delegation prompt:
- Dev agent's completion summary
- Which `needs-*` label triggered this review

---

## 2. Execute Review

### 2.1 Read Decision/Research Context

Before reviewing, use the decider skill's search workflow: `.agents/skills/decider/scripts/decisions search "[RELEVANT_KEYWORDS]"` for decisions governing the changed areas. If matches found, read the full decision files — index summaries are insufficient for understanding scope and rejected alternatives. If the delegation prompt includes additional decision context, read those too.

**Suggestions that contradict active decisions are invalid** unless the decision itself is flawed (flag as blocker with justification, citing the specific decision and why it's wrong).

### 2.2 Identify Changed Files

```bash
.agents/skills/github/scripts/git-diff-summary -C [WORKTREE_PATH]
```

Use domain grouping and risk flags to focus review on changed files relevant to your domain.
**Exclude**: Research documents — historical research artifacts, not reviewable code or docs.

### 2.3 Run Agent Review

Run your agent-specific review. See your agent file for exact commands and Output section for blocker/suggestion mapping.
Run each validation or read-only check as its own command per the reviewer skill's Harness-Safe Shell rule; do not combine checks into compound or composed shells under Codex `approval=never`.
Apply the reviewer skill's General Review Ethos and Reviewer Scope Boundaries. Stay within this agent's domain; do not duplicate another specialist unless your domain adds distinct evidence, impact, or remediation.

### 2.4 Classify Regressions (performance QA agent only)

**Skip if** not the performance QA agent or no regressions detected (exit code 0).

When the benchmarking skill's regression check exits with code 1, classify every regressed operation using the project's benchmarking skill. Populate `blockers[]` and `qa_metadata.perf_qa.regressions[]` per your agent's Output section.

### 2.5 Record Benchmark Results (performance QA agent only)

**Skip if** not the performance QA agent.

- Use the project's benchmarking skill's direct runner or recorder commands when
  they are documented as standalone commands.
- Do not use shell pipelines, redirection, heredocs, `tee`, `cat >`, inline
  environment assignment, command substitution, or shell plumbing to capture or
  record benchmark output under Codex `approval=never`.
- If the only documented recording path requires shell plumbing, stop and report
  the harness gap instead of inventing an alternate command shape.
- If manual entry is supported, pass the component name and JSON data only by a
  documented direct argument or body-file option. Do not create the body file
  with shell redirection.

See the project's benchmarking skill for full recording details if available.

If the project has feature-gated benchmark targets, performance QA must include
them in any claimed "full benchmark" run. A successful bare `cargo bench` is
not enough if active lanes require explicit features such as `live-feeds` or
`ui-bridge`.

If the parser records zero results, stop and report the harness gap instead of
counting the run as benchmark coverage. Common causes are missing required
features, parser prefix drift after bench refactors, or tool output format
changes.

If the benchmark recorder fails closed on all-zero counters, report a benchmark
environment/tooling failure. Include the command, commit, and error evidence in
the QA report, set `benchmark_commit` to `"none"`, and do not bypass the failure
with manual benchmark data.

If a targeted regression command reports numeric regressions but an aggregate
validation command passes, classify and report the targeted numeric regressions.
The aggregate validation result is supporting context, not a substitute for the
targeted regression output.

**Note**: Benchmark results may be symlinked to the main repo in worktrees. Results are written directly to main's directory — no commit needed. Record the latest commit SHA from your worktree branch as the benchmark commit in your return output (§ 3).

### 2.6 Return JSON Report

1. **Build JSON** per [`../schemas/review-finding.md`](../schemas/review-finding.md), filename `[WORKTREE_PATH]/tmp/review-[AGENT]-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json`.
   - `[AGENT]` is your FULL agent name, including its `reviewer-` prefix. For `reviewer-security` the file is `review-reviewer-security-20260720-141530.json`. The doubled `review-reviewer-` is correct — do not shorten or de-duplicate it to `review-security-…`; orch's `review-artifact-check` globs the literal full agent name and reports the artifact `missing` otherwise.
   - Standard fields: `agent`, `timestamp`, `verdict`, `summary`, `blockers[]`, `suggestions[]`
   - If performance QA agent: include `benchmark_commit` from § 2.5
   - `qa_metadata.[agent_type]` populated per your agent (project-configurable):

   | Agent | qa_metadata key | Required fields |
   |-------|-----------------|-----------------|
   | safety audit (example) | `safety` | `tool_results`, `unsafe_block_count`, `violations[]` |
   | performance QA (example) | `perf_qa` | `percentiles`, `regression_pct`, `regressions[]`, `platform`, `baseline_sha` |
   | architecture review (example) | `arch_review` | `dimension_scores`, `overall_score`, `pass` |

   **Verdict rules:**
   - `action_required`: 1+ items in `blockers[]`
   - `pass`: `blockers[]` empty

2. **Create the artifact** at `[WORKTREE_PATH]/tmp/review-[AGENT]-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json` — `[AGENT]` in full, prefix included (`reviewer-security` → `review-reviewer-security-20260720-141530.json`), never shortened to `review-security-…` — with the harness file-write/edit tool. In Codex, use `apply_patch` to add or update the exact path. Do not use shell redirection, heredocs, `tee`, `echo >`, command substitution, or redirected `cat` writes.

3. **Return the JSON** in your response so the calling agent can validate the same content:

---

## 3. Complete

Send this result to the orchestrator as an agent-to-agent message. **Writing the JSON to disk is not a return** — the orchestrator does not poll the filesystem, and turn text is not visible across team boundaries. Send exactly one message with the body below, then go idle.

**Return exactly** (`[AGENT]` and `[AGENT_NAME]` are both your full agent name including the `reviewer-` prefix — `reviewer-security` reports `agent: reviewer-security` and the file `review-reviewer-security-20260720-141530.json`):

<output_format>
QA_COMPLETE
verdict: [pass|action_required]
agent: [AGENT_NAME]
benchmark_commit: [SHA or "none"]
File: [WORKTREE_PATH]/tmp/review-[AGENT]-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json
```json
{complete JSON object}
```
</output_format>

## Constraints

**Do NOT**:
- Claim the issue (Linear `issues activate`, GitHub self-assign)
- Modify issue tracker state (labels, status)
- Mark issue done
- Create commits for code changes or push changes
- Call other subagents

**Note**: Benchmark results may be symlinked — writes go directly to main repo, no commit needed (§ 2.5).

**Orchestrator handles**: All issue tracker updates, routing blockers back to dev agent, merging JSONs, presentation.
