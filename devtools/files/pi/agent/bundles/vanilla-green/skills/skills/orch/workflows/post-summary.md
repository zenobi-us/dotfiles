# Post Summary Workflow

Post summary comments to git host and issue tracker, and selective handoff comments to downstream issues.

## Inputs

| Command | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `post-summary` | Post summary for current branch's issue |
| `post-summary [ISSUE_ID]` | Post summary for specific issue |
| (from start-worktree) | Managed lifecycle with caller context |

**Caller context parameters** (via `⤵`):
- `worktree`: worktree path
- `lifecycle` (optional): `"managed"` (return to caller at § 3) | `"self"` (default, standalone).
- `issue_id` (optional): workflow-state key — the normalized issue ID (`issue-N` for GitHub, `PROJ-123` for Linear), never the bare GitHub issue number. If absent, extracted from branch.
- `pr_number` (optional): PR number for git host comment. If absent, detected from branch.

**Standalone init** (`lifecycle: "self"` only):
```bash
# Extract issue from branch if not provided
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/git-context issue-from-branch .
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/tracker-for-issue [ISSUE_ID]
.agents/skills/worktree/scripts/worktree exists [ISSUE_ID]
.agents/skills/worktree/scripts/worktree path [ISSUE_ID]
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/pr-view-json [WT_PATH] --json number
# Init workflow state if not exists
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state exists --json [ISSUE_ID]
```
Use the first output as `ISSUE_ID` and the tracker output as `TRACKER`. Use current directory as `WT_PATH` unless `worktree exists` confirms a different path. Read `PR_NUMBER` from the PR JSON output. If `.exists` is `false`, initialize with `git-context branch [WT_PATH]` and `workflow-state init`.

## 1. Post Summary Comments

1. **Read state**:
   ```bash
   .agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state get [ISSUE_ID] '{fixed_count: (.fixed_items | length), escalated_count: (.escalated_items | length), audit_issues: (.audit_issues_created | length), pr_issues: (.pr_comment_review.issues_created | length), cycles: .cycles}'
   ```
   Read `fixed_count` as `FIXED_COUNT`, `escalated_count` as `ESCALATED_COUNT`, `audit_issues` as `AUDIT_ISSUES`, `pr_issues` as `PR_ISSUES`, and `cycles` as `CYCLES` from the JSON object.

2. **Skip if** `FIXED_COUNT == 0` AND `AUDIT_ISSUES == 0` AND `PR_ISSUES == 0` AND `ESCALATED_COUNT == 0`. → § 2

3. **Post to git host and issue tracker** — consolidate all review cycle results from state. Write to a file first (same backtick hazard as submit-pr PR body):
   ```bash
   mkdir -p [WORKTREE_PATH]/tmp
   .agents/skills/orch/scripts/git-context timestamp compact
   # Write SUMMARY_CONTENT to [WORKTREE_PATH]/tmp/post-summary-[ISSUE_ID]-[TIMESTAMP_FROM_PREVIOUS_COMMAND].md
   .agents/skills/github/scripts/github.sh post-comment [PR_NUMBER] --body-file "$SUMMARY_FILE"
   ```
   Use the summary file path as `SUMMARY_FILE`.

   Linear only — GitHub items get linkage via `Closes #N` in the PR body:

   ```bash
   .agents/skills/linear/scripts/linear.sh comments create [ISSUE_ID] --body-file "$SUMMARY_FILE"
   ```

   **Summary content template** (omit empty sections):

   ```markdown
   ## Completed Issues
   - Closes [ISSUE_ID] - [TITLE]
     - Closes [ISSUE_ID] - [SUB_TITLE]
     - Closes [ISSUE_ID] - [SUB_TITLE]

   ## Created Issues
   - [ISSUE_ID] - [TITLE] — [PROJECT]
   - [ISSUE_ID] - [TITLE] — [PROJECT]

   ## QA Metrics
   (project-specific metrics summary)

   ## Recommendations Processed

   ### Fixed in PR
   - [SOURCE]: [ITEM] — [SHA]

   ### Skipped
   - [SOURCE]: [ITEM] — [REASON]

   **Cycles**: [N] | [STATUS_SUMMARY]
   ```

   - **Completed Issues**: Use `Closes` keyword for issue tracker linkage. Indent sub-issues.
   - **Created Issues**: From `audit_issues_created` + `pr_comment_review.issues_created`. Include project name.
   - **QA Metrics**: Include if QA agents ran (project-configurable).
   - **Recommendations Processed**: Dedupe by description across cycles.
   - **Commit SHAs**: when workflow state carries a `.rebase_map` (recorded by `submit-pr.md` § 2 step 1 after a `worktree push` auto-rebase rewrote the branch), resolve every published SHA through it — follow the chain until no key matches. Publishing an unreconciled pre-rebase SHA is forbidden (vstack#728); fix SHAs stored in state were already rewritten at push time, so the map matters for artifact-sourced references like a perf QA `benchmark_commit`.

## 2. Post Handoff Comments (selective)

**Skip if** `TRACKER=github` (dependencies live in issue bodies, not tracked relations). → § 3

1. **Check unblocked issues**: run `.agents/skills/linear/scripts/linear.sh cache issues get [ISSUE_ID]`, then read `.blocks` from the JSON output.

2. **Evaluate conditions** — post handoff only if:
   - Downstream description references files touched in this PR
   - Decision created that downstream should know
   - API/interface change that downstream depends on

3. **Skip if** just unblocking by completion (most common case). → § 3

4. **Post handoff** (if conditions met):
   ```bash
   .agents/skills/linear/scripts/linear.sh comments create [DOWNSTREAM_ISSUE_ID] --body "Handoff from [ISSUE_ID]:
   - [RELEVANT_CONTEXT]"
   ```

## 3. Return State

**If managed**: Return to the parent workflow's next section.

**If standalone**: Session complete — summary posted.
