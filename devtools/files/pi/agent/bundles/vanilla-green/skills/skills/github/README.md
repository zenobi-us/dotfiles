# GitHub Queries

CLI wrapper for GitHub API operations used in PR workflows.

## Structure

- `scripts/github.sh` — Entry point (command router)
- `scripts/git-https-auth` — Git wrapper for per-command GitHub SSH→HTTPS fallback through `gh` auth
- `scripts/git-diff-summary` — Standalone changed-file domain/scope and risk-flag summary helper
- `scripts/commands/` — Individual command scripts
- `scripts/lib/gh-auth.sh` — Shared GitHub token resolution and keyring fallback helpers
- `scripts/lib/github-api.sh` — Shared library (auth, GraphQL, REST, error handling)
- `SKILL.md` — Agent-facing skill definition

## Setup

1. Authenticate: `gh auth login`
2. Optionally set `GH_BOT_TOKEN` in `.env.local` for bot account operations
3. Optionally set non-secret defaults such as `GH_ISSUE_PATTERN`, `GH_BOT_USERNAME`, and `GH_VERIFY_CMD` in committed `vstack.settings.toml`

```bash
./scripts/github.sh pr-view 123 --json number,title,state
./scripts/github.sh bot-token
./scripts/github.sh label-add 123 needs-review --required
./scripts/git-https-auth -C . fetch --prune origin
```

`label-add` checks the live label inventory, resolves the target, and lets
GitHub authorize the selected token's effective label-write grant. It does not
infer token access from the authenticated user's repository role, which may
differ for GitHub App and fine-grained tokens. Label names are always treated
as literal strings, including `@`-prefixed names and values resembling JSON
types or repository placeholders. The default `--required` policy reports a
missing label as configuration error and a known GitHub permission denial as a
capability error. Use `--optional` only when project policy permits the label
to be skipped; missing-label and permission failures then return a structured
`optional_unsupported` outcome. Those failures do not successfully mutate the
target. Authentication, lookup, rate-limit, server, and unexpected API failures
remain errors in either mode.

## Configuration

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Pre-resolved GitHub token from the parent process | Falls back to `gh` auth |
| `GH_BOT_TOKEN` | Bot account GitHub token | Falls back to `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN` for helper auth, then `gh` auth |
| `GH_BOT_USERNAME` | Bot username for filtering | `review-bot[bot]` |
| `GH_ISSUE_PATTERN` | Regex for branch issue extraction | `[A-Z]+-[0-9]+` |
| `VSTACK_GITHUB_OP_TIMEOUT` | Seconds to wait for `op read` token resolution | `10` |
| `VSTACK_GITHUB_AUTH_TIMEOUT` | Seconds to wait for `pr-view` auth preflight | `10` |
| `VSTACK_GITHUB_PR_VIEW_TIMEOUT` | Seconds to wait for `gh pr view` | `30` |
| `VSTACK_GITHUB_GIT_HTTPS_FALLBACK` | `auto`, `never`, or `always` for `git-https-auth` SSH→HTTPS fallback | `auto` |

Keep tokens in `.env.local` unless the parent process injects already-resolved secrets at launch. Token loaders preserve parent-process values over project files for the same variable. `github.sh` then selects one effective router token before resolving 1Password references: first resolved `GH_TOKEN`, then resolved `GH_BOT_TOKEN`, then resolved `GITHUB_TOKEN`; only if no resolved token exists does it consider unresolved `op://` references in that same order. `op read` is only called for that final selected reference. If the selected `op://` reference cannot resolve, `github.sh` drops `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` so `gh` can use keyring auth. Once a resolved `GH_BOT_TOKEN` is selected, helpers preserve that bot identity instead of replacing it with ambient keyring auth. Auth preflight validates selected env tokens with `gh api user`; `gh auth status` is only authoritative for keyring auth when no env token is selected. Bot-token operations still prefer an explicit `GH_BOT_TOKEN` over user-token variables. Shared non-secret defaults can live in `vstack.settings.toml` under `[env]`; `.env.local` still wins for local overrides.

`pr-view --json ...` emits normal `gh pr view` JSON on success. On failure it
emits structured JSON on stdout with `status` (`no_pr`, `auth_error`,
`token_resolution_failed`, `token_resolution_timeout`,
`token_resolution_unavailable`, `auth_timeout`, `gh_timeout`, or `gh_error`),
`error`, `detail`, `exit_code`, and `number:null`, then exits nonzero. Stderr
keeps the raw `gh`/`op` detail for logs.

`pr-merge --check` reports still-running checks as `ci_pending: ...` and sets
`transient: true` when those pending checks are the only blockers. Terminal
failed or cancelled checks remain `ci_failed: ...` and are not transient.
Actionable review threads (unresolved and not outdated), plus failures to read
thread state, are permanent blockers. They stop both immediate merge and
`--auto` before any merge or queue mutation. Only the explicit, dangerous
`--force` flag bypasses that safety gate. Thread retrieval follows every
GraphQL page and fails rather than treating an incomplete list as clean.
Merge execution is exact-head guarded. A successful mutation returns exit `0`
when already merged, exit `75` with a distinct message when either a required
merge-queue entry or classic auto-merge is active, and exit `1` when no merged,
queued, or armed postcondition can be proven. Required-queue membership is read
through GraphQL because `gh pr view --json` does not expose it.
`--force` remains immediate-only and cannot be combined with `--auto`; the
conflicting flags fail before any GitHub lookup or mutation. A nonzero forced
mutation returns exit `1` unless the exact-head post-state is already `MERGED`.
Auto-merge or queue enrollment active before the call cannot mask the failure.

## Git HTTPS Fallback

Use `scripts/git-https-auth` for the GitHub network operations in workflows
that should succeed with GitHub CLI auth even when project remotes are
SSH-backed. The helper detects GitHub SSH remotes or explicit GitHub SSH URLs,
validates the selected env token or `gh` keyring auth, and then runs the git
command with temporary `credential.helper=!gh auth git-credential` and
SSH-to-HTTPS rewrite config. It does not persist config and leaves non-GitHub
or unauthenticated git commands on the normal path.

Prefer targeted post-fetch sync commands in automation:

```bash
./scripts/git-https-auth -C "$repo" fetch --prune origin "+refs/heads/$base_branch:refs/remotes/origin/$base_branch"
git -C "$repo" merge --ff-only "origin/$base_branch"
```

Avoid `git fetch --all` in PR closure workflows unless every remote is required;
optional secondary remotes should not block syncing `origin` after a merge.
Fetch into the explicit `refs/remotes/origin/$base_branch` tracking ref and use
that same `origin/$base_branch` ref for post-merge sync so automation avoids
`git pull`'s branch/ref resolution ambiguity and does not depend on the
repository's configured `remote.origin.fetch` refspec.

## Adding a Command

1. Create `scripts/commands/<command-name>.sh`
2. Source `../lib/github-api.sh` for shared functions
3. Add a `show_help()` function
4. Add the command to the case statement in `scripts/github.sh`
5. Update the Commands table in `SKILL.md`

## Diff Summary Risk Flags

`git-diff-summary` emits JSON for review routing. Rust-specific risk flags
(`unsafe_code_added`, `repr_c_struct_changed`, `extern_c_changed`,
`atomics_modified`) scan added lines from `.rs` diffs only. Non-Rust scripts,
docs, and config can mention `unsafe`, `#[repr(C)]`, `extern "C"`, or
`Atomic` without triggering Rust risk flags.

## Verification (pr-cross-check --verify)

`verify-lib.sh` auto-detects the build system. Override order:
1. `GH_VERIFY_CMD` env var
2. `verify.sh` in project root
3. Auto-detect from `Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, `go.mod`, `pyproject.toml`, `Makefile`

## Dependencies

- `gh` CLI authenticated
- `jq`
- `op` CLI (optional, for 1Password token references)
