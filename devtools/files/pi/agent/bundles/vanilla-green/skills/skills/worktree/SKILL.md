# Worktree Management

Portable git worktree manager. Worktrees live outside the repo root by default — `<parent-of-checkout>/.worktrees/<checkout-name>/{id}` — so recursive editor/file watchers on the repo never ingest worktree build outputs, and sibling repos cannot collide on a shared parent dir. Projects can override the worktree parent directory with `WORKTREE_BASE_DIR`.

Issue-ID resolution prefers the configured base dir and falls back to the worktree registered for the issue branch, so trees created under an older base-dir convention keep working unmoved (`list`/`remove`/`push`/`restack`/`create --reuse`); there is no auto-migration. Path comparisons are canonical (physical, symlink-resolved on both sides), so a worktree registered under a legacy symlinked spelling and addressed via its physical path — or vice versa — is recognized as the same tree, never as a foreign one.

Issue IDs used to derive paths must match `[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]*` and must not contain `..`; examples such as `issue-779`, `CC-123`, and `ds-enforcement` are valid. Direct path arguments for mutating commands must be registered worktrees of this repository's common Git directory. `fix-links`, `codex-setup`, `codex-branch`, and `remove` refuse the main checkout and foreign worktrees; Codex app-created worktrees remain supported because they are registered git worktrees even when they live outside `WORKTREE_BASE_DIR`.

Resolves project root via `git rev-parse`, detects default branch automatically, and reads project-specific config from `.env`, `vstack.settings.toml`, then `.env.local` (`.env.local` wins).

```bash

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `create` | Claim a new issue worktree. Refuses implicit reuse when a worktree, branch, or PR already exists. |
| `restack` | Guardedly continue, skip, or abort a tool-created paused restack. |
| `list` | List all worktrees |
| `remove` | Remove worktree, clean symlinks, prune branches |
| `cleanup` | Remove worktrees whose branches are merged |
| `path` | Print worktree path for issue ID |
| `exists` | Check if worktree exists for issue ID |
| `check` | Pre-create git state check (JSON: uncommitted, unpushed) |
| `push` | Push worktree branch with auto-rebase |
| `codex-setup` | Apply env/config setup to a Codex Desktop app-created worktree |
| `codex-branch` | Normalize a Codex Desktop app-created branch to an issue branch |
| `codex-cleanup` | Non-destructive Codex Desktop cleanup hook; app owns deletion |

`push ISSUE_ID` normally resolves through the configured worktree registry. When run from a checkout whose current branch already matches the normalized issue branch, it pushes that active checkout instead. This supports Codex Desktop app-created worktrees that are valid git worktrees but are not registered under `WORKTREE_BASE_DIR`.

`push` and origin fetches use the GitHub skill's `git-https-auth` behavior when
available: GitHub SSH remotes stay unchanged by default, but if `gh` auth is
valid the git command gets temporary HTTPS rewrite and `gh auth git-credential`
config. This lets Codex/GitHub-authenticated sessions push without a working
SSH key. Set `VSTACK_GITHUB_GIT_HTTPS_FALLBACK=never` to force the normal SSH
path.

When `push` performs its auto-rebase, the following push uses a scoped
`--force-with-lease` pinned to the target branch OID known before the rebase.
`create --reuse` and the supported `create --restack` conflict-recovery flow
persist the same narrowly scoped authorization in the worktree: it records the
exact observed remote OID and the exact successfully restacked local head.
`push` accepts that rewritten head or later commits built on it, still pins the
force-with-lease to the recorded remote OID, and consumes the authorization
after success. A different local rewrite, remote movement while conflict
resolution is pending, or a moved remote at push time fails closed. Plain
pushes are still used with `--no-rebase`.

`remove` deletes the worktree before deleting the local branch. Branch deletion uses safe `git branch -d`; if that fails after worktree removal, the script exits non-zero with a diagnostic naming the remaining branch and manual `git branch -D` recovery command.

`cleanup` fetches `origin`, considers non-main registered worktrees, proves each branch is merged into `origin/<default>` (or the local default branch when the remote ref is unavailable), asks Git to remove the intact worktree, then deletes the proven-merged local branch. If Git cannot remove a worktree, cleanup exits nonzero and preserves its path, configured symlinks, and branch for manual recovery. If branch deletion fails after worktree removal, cleanup also exits nonzero and names the remaining branch.

When a configured symlink path is already tracked in the worktree branch, the script marks that path assume-unchanged before replacing it so `git status` stays clean.

Bare `create <ID>` is a new-work claim, not a discovery command. Every new-branch mode, including `--from`, checks the normalized issue branch, an explicit requested branch, and `BOT_NAME/<issue>` across worktrees, local/remote refs, and open PRs. Existing ownership exits 75 and leaves local branches unchanged. Origin remote-head or GitHub PR discovery failure exits 1 before worktree config, branch, or target-path mutation; never interpret an outage as absence. Unreachable secondary remotes are skipped with a warning — they cannot receive other sessions' pushes, so only origin is required for the claim gate; reachable secondary remotes still count as ownership signals. A repository-local normalized-issue claim lock holds the final repeated discovery through `git worktree add`, so concurrent claims cannot both mutate. Inspect or monitor owned work instead of spawning a second implementer. Run issue creates as separate commands and check each result; do not batch them in a shell loop whose final successful command can hide an earlier active-work exit.

An existing owner may opt in with `create <ID> --reuse`, which refreshes setup after rebasing onto `origin/<default>`. Reuse/restack requires the target's exact canonical path to be registered to this repository's common Git directory; incomplete directories are preserved and exit 75. Use `--restack` only to pause that intentional rebase in a conflict state. To inspect existing remote work whose issue worktree is absent, use `create <ID> --pr <N>` or `--base <branch>` explicitly.

### Codex Desktop hooks

Let Codex Desktop own app-created worktree creation and deletion. Configure project setup/cleanup hooks to run:

```bash
"$CODEX_SOURCE_TREE_PATH/.agents/skills/worktree/scripts/worktree" codex-setup "$CODEX_WORKTREE_PATH"
"$CODEX_SOURCE_TREE_PATH/.agents/skills/worktree/scripts/worktree" codex-cleanup "$CODEX_WORKTREE_PATH"
```

For issue workflows, run `codex-branch ISSUE_ID "$CODEX_WORKTREE_PATH"` before orchestration if the harness did not already normalize the branch.

### `create` flags

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--base BRANCH` | Checkout an existing remote branch into the worktree |
| `--from REF` | Create a new branch (named after ID) starting from REF after the normal ownership claim gate |
| `--pr NUMBER` | Look up the branch from a GitHub PR number (implies `--base`) |
| `--reuse` | Explicitly reuse an existing issue worktree and rebase it onto `origin/<default>` |
| `--restack` | When reusing an existing worktree and its rebase onto `origin/<default>` conflicts, stop in the conflict state for resolution instead of aborting |
| `--recover-local` | Recreate a missing worktree for the exact local-only issue branch without rebasing or rewriting its commits |

### Recovering a local-only branch after worktree loss

If an issue worktree was removed outside this tool after commits were made but before the branch was pushed, the exact normalized issue branch can survive locally without any checkout. Recover it explicitly:

```bash
.agents/skills/worktree/scripts/worktree create ISSUE_ID --recover-local
```

Recovery is not a shortcut around the new-work claim gate. Bare `create <ID>` continues to exit 75 for the surviving local branch and points the owning session to this explicit mode. Recovery accepts only the exact normalized issue branch (for example, `CC-123` → `cc-123`), records its commit tip, recreates it at the currently configured `WORKTREE_BASE_DIR` path, verifies the same branch and tip were checked out, and reapplies all configured setup. It never rebases, resets, deletes, or rewrites the surviving branch.

The command fails closed if the target path exists; any active, stale, or incomplete worktree registration owns the branch; the branch is missing, non-commit, the default branch, unrelated to `origin/<default>`, or has an upstream; or any matching remote branch, open PR, or alternate bot-prefixed candidate exists. Unlike an ordinary new-work claim, recovery requires every configured remote to be reachable because an unqueried secondary could already own the supposedly local-only branch. Remote/PR discovery is repeated under the normal per-issue claim lock before creation.

The exact local branch tip is snapshotted before any fetch-capable step. Recovery refreshes only `origin/<default>` into its remote-tracking ref with an explicit forced, no-tags/no-prune refspec; the force accepts an authoritative default-branch rewrite but is constrained to `refs/remotes/origin/*`. It does not honor a configured mirror-style fetch refspec that could prune or rewrite `refs/heads/*`. The local branch must still equal the snapshot immediately before creation. Inspect and reconcile any refusal instead of forcing recovery.

### Reuse rebase conflicts

Bare `create` never rebases an existing worktree. After the owning session opts in with `--reuse`, the branch rebases onto `origin/<default>`. If that rebase conflicts, the run aborts the rebase and exits 1 — the worktree is left clean on its pre-rebase state, so there is no conflict left to resolve in place. The error lists the conflicting files (captured before the abort) and the two supported recovery paths:

1. **Resolve in place:** re-run `create <ID> --restack`. The rebase re-runs and pauses in the conflict state. Resolve the listed files, stage each with `git -C <path> add <file>`, then run `worktree restack continue <ID>`; repeat if it stops again. If the current commit is already represented by the new base and should be omitted, use `worktree restack skip <ID>`. Use `worktree restack abort <ID>` to restore the pre-restack branch.
2. **Discard divergence:** `remove <ID>` then `create <ID>` recreates the worktree fresh from `origin/<default>`, losing the local commits that conflicted.

The guarded actions accept only a registered worktree whose worktree-local restack authorization, tool-created state token, and Git sequencer metadata agree on the exact remote, branch, observed remote OID, original head, and target base. `continue` and `skip` re-check the remote before and after replay, finalize the exact rewritten-head lease when complete, and fail closed on missing, stale, or unrelated state. `abort` requires the same matching local state, restores the recorded original head, and clears only the pending authorization; remote movement does not make that restorative action unsafe. Published paused states created by the pre-token tool remain recoverable when all legacy authorization and sequencer fields match exactly. With no conflict, `--restack` completes the same intentional rebase as `--reuse`.

### Policy-blocked rebase (cherry-pick replay fallback)

Some execution policies reject top-level `git rebase` porcelain outright — Codex `approval_policy = never` rejects it with `approval required by policy, but AskForApproval is set to Never`, and no approval can ever arrive. That rejection names the command, not the goal: do not retry the same porcelain, do not delegate it to a sub-agent, and never substitute a raw `--force` push.

**First choice — the supported tool path.** Every guarded restack command is a single simple helper invocation with no top-level rebase porcelain: `create <ID> --reuse` performs the rebase onto `origin/<default>` inside the tool and records the exact lease `worktree push` needs, `create <ID> --restack` pauses a conflicting rebase for resolution, and `worktree restack continue|skip|abort <ID>` controls the paused state. Use this path whenever the checkout is a registered issue worktree.

**Cherry-pick replay — only when the tool path is unavailable or also rejected.** The replay produces the same rebased history from single simple commands: it detaches at the new base, replays the branch's unique commits in order, moves the branch ref only after the whole replay succeeds, and publishes with the same pinned-lease model the tool uses. Run each fenced command below as exactly one command per tool call; take derived values from a previous command's printed output, never from `$(...)` substitution.

1. **Clean-worktree check** — the output must be empty; never replay over uncommitted changes:

   ```bash
   git -C <path> status --porcelain
   ```

2. **Fetch** the current remote state:

   ```bash
   git -C <path> fetch origin
   ```

3. **Record the observed remote head** — use the printed OID as `<remote-oid>` in steps 4 and 10. If the ref does not exist the branch is unpublished: skip step 4, and finish with `worktree push <ID> --set-upstream` instead of step 10.

   ```bash
   git -C <path> rev-parse refs/remotes/origin/<branch>
   ```

4. **Ancestry check** (the tool's own lease rule) — exit status must be 0. Nonzero means the remote holds commits this checkout has never observed: stop and reconcile; replaying would overwrite them.

   ```bash
   git -C <path> merge-base --is-ancestor <remote-oid> <branch>
   ```

   Also stop if there is nothing to restack: `git -C <path> merge-base --is-ancestor origin/<default> <branch>` exiting 0 means the branch already contains the new base.

5. **List the commits to replay**, oldest first, and record the list:

   ```bash
   git -C <path> log --oneline --reverse origin/<default>..<branch>
   ```

6. **Detach at the new base.** Detaching is worktree-safe: it never checks out `<default>` as a branch, so it cannot collide with the main checkout.

   ```bash
   git -C <path> checkout --detach origin/<default>
   ```

7. **Replay the unique commits in order** (same range as step 5; git applies it oldest first):

   ```bash
   git -C <path> cherry-pick origin/<default>..<branch>
   ```

   If the range contains a merge commit the replay stops without picking it; run the abort control below and use the supported tool path or manual reconciliation instead.

8. **Conflict controls** — the policy-shaped equivalents of `restack continue|skip|abort`. On a conflict stop, edit the conflicting files with harness file-edit tools (never shell redirection), stage each one, then continue:

   ```bash
   git -C <path> add <file>
   ```

   ```bash
   git -C <path> -c core.editor=true cherry-pick --continue
   ```

   `-c core.editor=true` keeps git from opening an interactive editor; it is a git flag, not an env-assignment prefix, so the command stays a single simple command. If the stopped pick is already represented by the new base (git reports the pick is now empty), skip it:

   ```bash
   git -C <path> cherry-pick --skip
   ```

   To back out entirely — the branch ref has not moved yet, so aborting restores everything; reattach afterward with `git -C <path> checkout <branch>`:

   ```bash
   git -C <path> cherry-pick --abort
   ```

9. **Verify the replayed tip and move the branch.** First confirm the new base is contained — exit status must be 0:

   ```bash
   git -C <path> merge-base --is-ancestor origin/<default> HEAD
   ```

   Then move the branch ref to the replayed tip (the first ref mutation of the whole procedure) and reattach the worktree to it:

   ```bash
   git -C <path> branch -f <branch> HEAD
   ```

   ```bash
   git -C <path> checkout <branch>
   ```

10. **Publish with the pinned lease** — the exact `<remote-oid>` recorded in step 3, so the push fails closed if the remote moved. `worktree push` refuses manual rewrites by design (its rewritten-push authorization is recorded only by the tool's own supported restack), so this one command is the documented completion; never use raw `--force`, and never an unpinned `--force-with-lease` (a background fetch can move the tracking ref and defeat it):

    ```bash
    git -C <path> push origin <branch> --force-with-lease=refs/heads/<branch>:<remote-oid>
    ```

11. **Restore worktree setup** — the replay can replace configured symlinks with tracked content, exactly like a manual rebase:

    ```bash
    .agents/skills/worktree/scripts/worktree fix-links <ID>
    ```

## System Dependencies

- `git`
- authenticated `gh` for new-work PR ownership discovery
- `flock` for repository-local per-issue claim serialization
- Bash 3.2+ (macOS system bash is supported)

## Configuration

Set non-sensitive defaults in committed `vstack.settings.toml` under `[env]`. Existing `.env` and `.env.local` variables still work, and `.env.local` wins for secrets or personal overrides.

| Variable | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `WORKTREE_BASE_DIR` | Parent directory for created worktrees. Relative paths resolve from the main checkout; absolute paths and `~` are used as-is. Default: `../.worktrees/<checkout-name>` (external per-repo dir beside the checkout). Do not point it inside the repo root: worktree build outputs under the repo can exhaust recursive file-watcher (inotify) budgets |
| `WORKTREE_SYMLINKS` | Space-separated paths symlinked from main checkout into each worktree; include `.env.local` only if worktrees should share local secrets/overrides |
| `WORKTREE_RELATIVE_SYMLINKS` | Space-separated `path=target` symlinks created inside each worktree, with relative targets resolving from the link location |
| `WORKTREE_COPIES` | Space-separated files copied from main checkout into each worktree |
| `WORKTREE_MKDIRS` | Space-separated directories created inside each worktree with `mkdir -p`; use for gitignored scratch dirs such as `tmp` |

Configured setup paths (`WORKTREE_SYMLINKS`, `WORKTREE_COPIES`, `WORKTREE_MKDIRS`, and the path side of `WORKTREE_RELATIVE_SYMLINKS`) must be worktree-relative literal paths without `.`, `..`, absolute, backslash, or shell glob metacharacter components (`*`, `?`, `[`, `]`). A configured symlink path cannot also be, contain, or parent another configured setup path, because later mkdir/copy/link operations would follow the symlink target. Existing symlink parents are rejected before writes. Copy and mkdir destinations also reject leaf symlinks. File and relative-symlink destinations may replace an existing leaf symlink or file without following it, but refuse a real directory leaf.

Example: share local env plus generated Claude assets, but keep `.claude/CLAUDE.md` pointed at each worktree's own `AGENTS.md`:

```toml
[env]
WORKTREE_BASE_DIR = "~/dev/.worktrees/myproject"
WORKTREE_SYMLINKS = ".env.local .claude/agents .claude/hooks .claude/skills"
WORKTREE_RELATIVE_SYMLINKS = ".claude/CLAUDE.md=../AGENTS.md"
WORKTREE_MKDIRS = "tmp"
```
