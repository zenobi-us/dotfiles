# Dev Workflows

Agent workflows for issue implementation and review fix processing, for specialist agents receiving delegations from an orchestrator.

## Workflows

| Workflow | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `workflows/dev-implement.md` | Full implementation lifecycle: sync/activate → plan → implement → validate → commit → QA labels → summary → finalize (§ 1-11) |
| `workflows/dev-fix.md` | Process review fix items: evaluate → apply/skip → validate → commit → return |

Code-review and QA-review workflows live in the reviewer skill: `skills/reviewer/workflows/review.md` and `skills/reviewer/workflows/qa-review.md`.
