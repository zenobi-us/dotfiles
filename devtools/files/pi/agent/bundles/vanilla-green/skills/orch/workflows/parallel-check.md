# Parallel Work Check

Check whether multiple issues are safe to hand off simultaneously. Stores cached analysis only; does not launch or monitor sessions.

## Inputs

| Input | Source |
|-------|--------|
| `issues` | Linear issue IDs, GitHub issue refs, or a Linear project name |

## 1. Resolve Items

1. If args are issue IDs/refs, use them directly.
2. If a Linear project name was provided:
   ```bash
   .agents/skills/linear/scripts/linear.sh cache issues list --project "[PROJECT]" --state "Todo" --format=ids
   ```
3. Require at least two items.

## 2. Fetch Scope

For each Linear issue:

```bash
.agents/skills/linear/scripts/linear.sh cache issues get [ISSUE_ID] --with-bundle
```

For each GitHub issue:

```bash
gh issue view [N] --repo [OWNER/REPO] --json number,title,body,labels
```

Collect title, body/description, labels, dependencies, files/modules mentioned, and bundle children.

## 3. Analyze Coupling

Check for:
- Direct dependencies between items.
- Shared blockers or pending research.
- Same agent/domain assignment.
- File/module overlap.
- Shared public types, APIs, schema, migrations, or build manifests.
- Existing worktrees or open PRs.

Apply constraints:

| Constraint | Limit |
|------------|-------|
| Max group size | 5 |
| Max same-domain per group | 3 |
| Source-modifying same-domain items | split unless low overlap |
| Same manifest edits | conflict |

## 4. Present Verdict

<output_format>
### Parallel Check

| Item | Domain | Scope | Blockers |
|------|--------|-------|----------|
| [ID] | [DOMAIN] | [FILES/MODULES] | [none|IDs] |

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Dependencies | [result] |
| File overlap | [result] |
| API/type flow | [result] |
| Build config | [result] |
| Active work | [result] |

Verdict: [SAFE|CONFLICTS]
Safe groups: [GROUPS]
</output_format>

## 5. Persist

Clear and write current analysis:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/parallel-groups clear
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/parallel-groups write '[GROUP_JSON]'
```

Group JSON:

```json
{
  "issues": ["ID-1", "ID-2"],
  "verdict": "safe",
  "source": "manual|project",
  "conflicts": [],
  "issue_fingerprints": {}
}
```

## 6. End

Suggest `orch handoff` only for safe groups the user explicitly wants to launch.
