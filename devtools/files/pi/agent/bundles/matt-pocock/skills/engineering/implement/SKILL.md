## Language

All agent-authored prose MUST follow **ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English**. Apply it to questions, explanations, recommendations, issue text, reports, handoffs, and procedures.

- Use short, complete sentences and active voice.
- Use one term for one meaning.
- Put conditions before commands.
- Use imperative sentences for procedures.
- Keep code, identifiers, commands, quoted text, product names, and exact domain terms unchanged.
- Use the `simple-english` skill for the full rule set.

Implement the work described by the user in the spec or tickets.

Use /tdd where possible, at pre-agreed seams.

Run typechecking regularly, single test files regularly, and the full test suite once at the end.

Once done, use /code-review to review the work.

Commit your work to the current branch.
