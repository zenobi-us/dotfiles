// Deterministic enumeration of a Claude account's installed claude.ai connectors.
//
// The capability probe this replaces asked the MODEL to enumerate connectors via
// ToolSearch. A search returns what the search surfaced, which is a LOWER BOUND —
// nothing in the result distinguishes "these are the connectors" from "these are
// the connectors the search happened to return this time". Downstream then stored
// that lower bound as authoritative, so an account with Slack attached could
// report an inventory without Slack and no failure signal (vstack#838).
//
// This module asks the account instead of the model. Verified live against a
// personal claude_max org: the endpoint is POST (a GET returns 405) and each
// result carries BOTH `directoryUuid` (the catalog identity) and
// `installedServerId` (this account's installed instance). A marketplace catalog
// entry has no installed-server id, which is what establishes this as the
// INSTALLED set rather than the registry listing.
//
// INSTALLED IS NOT ATTACHED. This endpoint reports what the ACCOUNT has
// installed. It says nothing about whether a given connector's MCP server has
// finished attaching inside the `claude` child that is about to run a turn —
// this is a plain HTTPS call and does not consult that process at all. The two
// were previously conflated by accident: the ToolSearch probe could only report
// what was already attached, so an inventory implied availability (wrongly, but
// conservatively — it under-reported, which fails safe). They are now separately
// observable and can legitimately disagree: a correct `complete: true` inventory
// can name Slack while `mcp__claude_ai_Slack__*` is not yet callable in this
// process (vstack#832). Treat an inventory as NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT for
// availability and keep an attach-time check on the call path; do not derive
// "can I call this tool right now" from this result.
//
// Because the answer comes from the account rather than a model turn, the result
// is complete by construction — hence `complete: true` on success, and no
// "partial" state. A failure is a failure, never an empty-but-successful list.

 * be allowed to call neither copy reliably. Verified live: keyed as the CLI's
 * name there is ONE server entry and one namespace (27 servers); keyed otherwise
 * both appear (28 servers).
 *
 * What merges is the NAMESPACE, not the connection. Under the shared name the
 * declaration and the CLI's own loader each still connect: across 40 cold runs
 * the baseline logged 1 Slack connect (7 proxy connects total) and the declared
 * arm logged 2 Slack connects (8 total), in 20 of 20 runs with no exceptions.
 * Declaring N connectors therefore costs ~2N connections, not N. They run in
 * parallel — slowest-connect per run moved from a 1192ms median to 1278ms, worst
 * 1544ms, well inside the 5s cap — but that was measured with ONE declaration.
