// Audit trail for connector calls the `claude` child executes itself.
//
// A claude.ai connector tool runs INSIDE the child, on the child's own MCP
// servers, and is deliberately never mirrored into the Pi stream (see
// isChildExecutedTool). That is the honest behaviour — mirroring wrote
// `Tool <name> not found` into the transcript for calls that had SUCCEEDED
// (drovr#311 / memsira#320) — but it leaves the Pi session with no record that
// the call happened at all, so "did it really look that up?" could only be
// answered from the child's own transcript.
//
// A pi `CustomEntry` closes that gap without reintroducing the bug: it is
// persisted in the session file, is NOT a content block, and is documented as
// "ignored by buildSessionContext", so Pi's agent loop can never dispatch it and
// `convertPiMessages` (which reads messages, not entries) can never project it
// back into the child's session. `CustomMessageEntry` is the sibling type that
// DOES enter context — using it here would recreate the whole problem.
//
// The payload is never recorded. A connector result is live account data (mail,
// messages, documents); the audit answers whether a call happened and what came
// back, not what it said.
