# Subagent Example

Delegate tasks to specialized subagents with isolated context windows.

## Features

- **Isolated context**: Each subagent runs in a separate `pi` process
- **Streaming output**: See tool calls and progress as they happen
- **Parallel streaming**: All parallel tasks stream updates simultaneously
- **Markdown rendering**: Final output rendered with proper formatting (expanded view)
- **Usage tracking**: Shows turns, tokens, cost, and context usage per agent
- **Abort support**: Ctrl+C propagates to kill subagent processes

```

## Installation

From the repository root, symlink the files:

```bash
# Symlink the extension (must be in a subdirectory with index.ts)
mkdir -p ~/.pi/agent/extensions/subagent
ln -sf "$(pwd)/packages/coding-agent/examples/extensions/subagent/index.ts" ~/.pi/agent/extensions/subagent/index.ts
ln -sf "$(pwd)/packages/coding-agent/examples/extensions/subagent/agents.ts" ~/.pi/agent/extensions/subagent/agents.ts

# Symlink agents
mkdir -p ~/.pi/agent/agents
for f in packages/coding-agent/examples/extensions/subagent/agents/*.md; do
  ln -sf "$(pwd)/$f" ~/.pi/agent/agents/$(basename "$f")
done

# Symlink workflow prompts
mkdir -p ~/.pi/agent/prompts
for f in packages/coding-agent/examples/extensions/subagent/prompts/*.md; do
  ln -sf "$(pwd)/$f" ~/.pi/agent/prompts/$(basename "$f")
done
```

## Security Model

This tool executes a separate `pi` subprocess with a delegated system prompt and tool/model configuration.

Agents are discovered from:
- `~/.pi/agent/agents/*.md` - User-level agents (always loaded)
- `.pi/agents/*.md` - Project-level agents (searched upward from current directory to git root)

Project-local agents can instruct the model to read files, run bash commands, etc. Only use agents from repositories you trust.

## Management Commands

The `/subagent` command provides management capabilities for creating and organizing agents.

### List Agents

List available agents:

```
/subagent list [--verbose]
```

**Examples:**
```
/subagent list
/subagent list --verbose
```

**Options:**
- `--verbose` - Show full descriptions and file paths

### Add Agent

Create a new agent definition from a template:

```
/subagent add <name> [--template basic|scout|worker]
```

**Examples:**
```
/subagent add my-agent
/subagent add my-scout --template scout
/subagent add analyzer --template worker
```

**Options:**
- `--template basic|scout|worker` - Agent template to use (default: `basic`)
  - `basic` - Minimal template with name, description, and system prompt
  - `scout` - Fast reconnaissance template with read/grep/find/bash tools
  - `worker` - Full-capability template with all default tools

**Agent Naming:**
- Must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores
- Must start with a letter
- Must end with a letter or number

**Note:** Agents are always created in `~/.pi/agent/agents/` (user-level, available globally)

### Edit Agent

Show the location of an existing agent for editing:

```
/subagent edit <name>
```

**Examples:**
```
/subagent edit scout
/subagent edit my-agent
```

The command displays the file path where the agent is defined. Use your preferred editor to modify the agent configuration and system prompt. Changes take effect on the next subagent invocation.

## Usage

### Single agent
```
Use scout to find all authentication code
```

### Parallel execution
```
Run 2 scouts in parallel: one to find models, one to find providers
```

### Chained workflow
```
Use a chain: first have scout find the read tool, then have planner suggest improvements
```

### Workflow prompts
```
/implement add Redis caching to the session store
/scout-and-plan refactor auth to support OAuth
/implement-and-review add input validation to API endpoints
```

## Tool Modes

| Mode | Parameter | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Single | `{ agent, task }` | One agent, one task |
| Parallel | `{ tasks: [...] }` | Multiple agents run concurrently (max 8, 4 concurrent) |
| Chain | `{ chain: [...] }` | Sequential with `{previous}` placeholder |

## Output Display

**Collapsed view** (default):
- Status icon (✓/✗/⏳) and agent name
- Last 5-10 items (tool calls and text)
- Usage stats: `3 turns ↑input ↓output RcacheRead WcacheWrite $cost ctx:contextTokens model`

**Expanded view** (Ctrl+O):
- Full task text
- All tool calls with formatted arguments
- Final output rendered as Markdown
- Per-task usage (for chain/parallel)

**Parallel mode streaming**:
- Shows all tasks with live status (⏳ running, ✓ done, ✗ failed)
- Updates as each task makes progress
- Shows "2/3 done, 1 running" status

**Tool call formatting** (mimics built-in tools):
- `$ command` for bash
- `read ~/path:1-10` for read
- `grep /pattern/ in ~/path` for grep
- etc.

## Agent Definitions

Agents are markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: my-agent
description: What this agent does
tools: read, grep, find, ls
model: claude-haiku-4-5
---

System prompt for the agent goes here.
```

**Locations:**
- `~/.pi/agent/agents/*.md` - User-level (always loaded)
- `.pi/agents/*.md` - Project-level (searched upward from current directory to git root)

Project agents override user agents with the same name.

## Sample Agents

| Agent | Purpose | Model | Tools |
|-------|---------|-------|-------|
| `scout` | Fast codebase recon | Haiku | read, grep, find, ls, bash |
| `planner` | Implementation plans | Sonnet | read, grep, find, ls |
| `reviewer` | Code review | Sonnet | read, grep, find, ls, bash |
| `worker` | General-purpose | Sonnet | (all default) |

## Workflow Prompts

| Prompt | Flow |
|--------|------|
| `/implement <query>` | scout → planner → worker |
| `/scout-and-plan <query>` | scout → planner |
| `/implement-and-review <query>` | worker → reviewer → worker |

## Error Handling

- **Exit code != 0**: Tool returns error with stderr/output
- **stopReason "error"**: LLM error propagated with error message
- **stopReason "aborted"**: User abort (Ctrl+C) kills subprocess, throws error
- **Chain mode**: Stops at first failing step, reports which step failed

## Limitations

- Output truncated to last 10 items in collapsed view (expand to see all)
- Agents discovered fresh on each invocation (allows editing mid-session)
- Parallel mode limited to 8 tasks, 4 concurrent
