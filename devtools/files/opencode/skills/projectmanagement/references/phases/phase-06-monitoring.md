# Phase 6: Monitoring and Controlling

**Goal:** Oversee project progress and make adjustments as needed to keep project on track.

**Runs parallel to Phase 5 (Execution) - not sequential**

## Overview

This phase doesn't happen after execution - it happens DURING execution. The project manager monitors progress continuously and makes adjustments in real-time.

## Regular Reviews (Run Continuously During Execution)

### Weekly or Bi-Weekly

1. **Review task status:**
   - How many [Task] are To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done, Blocked?
   - Is progress tracking to schedule?
   - Are blockers being resolved?

2. **Check blockers:**
   - Are any [Task] marked "Blocked"? Why?
   - Can you unblock them (different dependencies, additional resources)?
   - How long have they been blocked?

3. **Talk to team:**
   - How are assignees feeling about their work?
   - Do they have blockers not yet reported?
   - Are estimates holding up or were they wrong?
   - Any new risks emerging?

4. **Update [Project Artifacts]:**
   - Are artifact statuses up-to-date?
   - Have any [Decision] artifacts been created? Link them properly.
   - Has scope changed? Document it.

### Identify Deviations from Plan

**Look for:**
- Tasks falling behind schedule
- Estimates significantly wrong (actual > estimate)
- Blockers not being resolved quickly
- New risks or dependencies discovered
- Scope creep (more work than planned)
- Resource issues (people reassigned, skills gaps)

### Corrective Actions

For each deviation, take action:

**If a task is falling behind:**
- Talk to assignee: What's the root cause?
- Is estimate wrong? Document and adjust.
- Can you help (additional resources, unblock dependencies)?
- Is scope larger than expected? Document scope change.
- Adjust timeline if needed (communicate to stakeholders).

**If new risks emerge:**
- Document as [Decision] with status "Unresolved" or link to existing [Decision]
- Develop mitigation strategy
- Add new tasks if needed
- Update timeline

**If scope is changing:**
- Document what's different from [Spec]
- Is this new work or refinement?
- Add new [Task] if out of scope
- Update [Epic]/[Story] artifacts
- Communicate impact to stakeholders

**If someone is blocked or needs reassignment:**
- Use `sessions*` tools to coordinate
- Provide additional context/resources
- Find workarounds if possible
- Escalate if blocking multiple people

## Communication

**Keep stakeholders informed:**
- Regular status updates (weekly or as needed)
- Highlight any significant changes
- Share blockers and mitigation plans
- Alert early if timeline looks at risk
- Document all changes in artifacts

## Validation Checkpoint (Mid-Phase 5)

**Periodically verify:**

- [ ] Regular status reviews are happening (weekly or more)
- [ ] Any deviations from plan are documented
- [ ] Corrective actions are being taken
- [ ] [Project Artifacts] reflect current state
- [ ] Team members confirm work is progressing as expected
- [ ] No [Task] have been blocked for > 1 week without resolution plan
- [ ] Stakeholders are informed of significant changes

**If any item fails, take corrective action immediately.**

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ **Not monitoring** → Find out about problems too late
- ❌ **Ignoring blockers** → People stay blocked waiting for help
- ❌ **Not updating artifacts** → Everyone working from stale info
- ❌ **Scope creep untracked** → Project balloons without anyone realizing
- ❌ **Not communicating** → Stakeholders blindsided by delays
- ❌ **Blaming individuals** → Creates defensive behavior
- ❌ **Making changes without documenting** → Nobody knows what changed or why

## Tips for Success

- ✅ Monitor continuously, not just at the end
- ✅ Be proactive about blockers (offer help, don't wait for ask)
- ✅ Document all changes (scope, timeline, decisions)
- ✅ Ask "why?" when something deviates from plan
- ✅ Fix problems early (easier to fix now than late)
- ✅ Celebrate progress (keep morale up)
- ✅ Adjust timeline honestly (better to say "2 weeks" than "1 week" late)
- ✅ Use [Decision] artifacts to document mid-course corrections
- ✅ Keep stakeholders in the loop (especially if timeline changes)
