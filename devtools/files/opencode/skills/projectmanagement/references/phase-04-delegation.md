# Phase 4: Delegation

**Goal:** Assign [Task] to team members with clear context and expectations.

**Prerequisite:** Phase 3 (Planning - Tasks) must be complete.

## Overview

Delegation is about more than just assigning work. It's about:
- Ensuring the right person has the right skills for the task
- Providing context about why the task exists
- Setting up for success with clear expectations
- Getting acknowledgment and commitment

## Steps

1. Review the list of [Task] created in Phase 3
2. For each [Task], assess:
   - Required skills
   - Estimated effort (story points)
   - Dependencies (what blocks this task)
   - Who depends on this task (what it unblocks)
3. Consider each team member:
   - Current skills and expertise
   - Availability
   - Current workload
   - Growth opportunities
4. Assign each [Task] to the most suitable person
5. Communicate clearly with each team member:
   - What [Task] they're assigned
   - Why it's important (link to [Story], [Epic], [Spec])
   - What it depends on
   - What depends on it
   - When it's needed (target date)
   - Definition of Done criteria
6. Get acknowledgment from each team member
7. Verify no one is overloaded beyond their capacity

## Using Superpowers Skills

This skill recommends using:
- `skills_superpowers_dispatching_parallel_agents` - For managing multiple parallel work streams
- `skills_superpowers_subagent_driven_development` - For coordinating team member work

These help with complex delegation scenarios across multiple people.

## Delegation Checklist

**For each task assignment, ensure:**

- [ ] Task is assigned to someone with appropriate skills
- [ ] Assignee understands what "done" means (Definition of Done)
- [ ] Assignee knows dependencies (what they need before starting)
- [ ] Assignee knows what depends on them (who's waiting)
- [ ] Target date/deadline is clear
- [ ] Assignee has acknowledged and committed to the work
- [ ] Assignee has context (link to Story, Epic, Spec)
- [ ] Blocking/critical path tasks are highlighted as high-priority

## Validation Checklist (CRITICAL - Complete before Phase 5)

**The following MUST be true before moving to Execution:**

- [ ] All [Task] have been assigned to team members
- [ ] Each assignee has acknowledged their assignment
- [ ] No team member is overloaded beyond their capacity
- [ ] Assignees understand dependencies and deadlines
- [ ] High-risk tasks (on critical path, many blockers) have been flagged
- [ ] Each assignee knows their task's impact (what it unlocks)

**If any item is not checked, DO NOT proceed to Phase 5. Return to assignments.**

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ **Assigning without context** → People don't understand why they're doing work
- ❌ **Not checking capacity** → Burnout, missed deadlines
- ❌ **Forgetting dependencies** → People start blocked
- ❌ **No acknowledgment** → People ignore assignments
- ❌ **Unclear deadlines** → Work gets deprioritized
- ❌ **Not highlighting critical path** → Low-risk work gets attention over blocking items

## Tips for Success

- ✅ Use skill context when assigning (match skills to task requirements)
- ✅ Provide links to relevant [Research] and [Decision] artifacts
- ✅ Be clear about blockers - is work actually ready to start?
- ✅ Highlight critical path tasks - these need extra attention
- ✅ Check in on capacity - ask people directly if workload is reasonable
- ✅ Use `sessions*` tools (recommended in SKILL) to communicate
- ✅ Get written acknowledgment/commitment from each person

## Next Step

Once validation checklist is complete → **Phase 5: Execution**
