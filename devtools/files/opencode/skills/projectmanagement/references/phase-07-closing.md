# Phase 7: Closing and Retrospective

**Goal:** Complete the project and document lessons learned.

**Prerequisite:** Phase 5 (Execution) must be complete with all [Task] marked as Done.

## Steps

### 1. Prepare for Retrospective

1. Review all completed [Task], [Story], and [Epic] artifacts
2. Collect any [Decision] artifacts with status "Unresolved"
3. Gather any [Decision] artifacts created during execution
4. Note any changes from original plan (scope changes, timeline changes, resource changes)

### 2. Conduct Retrospective Meeting

1. **Schedule with full team** (everyone involved in the project)
2. **Ask three main questions:**
   - What went well? (celebrate successes)
   - What could be improved? (identify issues)
   - What did we learn? (capture insights)

3. **Specific topics to discuss:**
   - How accurate were estimates?
   - Were processes working?
   - Did communication work?
   - Were there unexpected challenges?
   - Did scope creep happen? Why?
   - How was team morale?
   - Anything that surprised you?

4. **Document feedback:**
   - Take notes (who said what)
   - Ask clarifying questions
   - Don't defend decisions yet - just listen

### 3. Create Retrospective Artifact

1. Create [Retrospective] artifact using `references/templates/retrospective_template.md`
2. Document:
   - What went well (with context and examples)
   - What could be improved (with root causes)
   - Lessons learned (insights to carry forward)
   - Metrics (timeline, scope, quality, team satisfaction)
   - Process improvements (specific, actionable)
   - Follow-up actions (who, what, when)

3. Link all unresolved [Decision] artifacts to the [Retrospective]
4. Document which decisions are still unresolved and why they matter

### 4. Review Unresolved Decisions

For each [Decision] artifact with status "Unresolved":

1. **Discuss in retrospective:** Is this decision finally resolved?
2. **If resolved:** Update status to "Decided" or "Superseded"
3. **If still unresolved:** Document in [Retrospective] why and when it should be revisited
4. **Link to retrospective:** All unresolved decisions should link to [Retrospective]

### 5. Document Process Improvements

Identify specific, actionable improvements for next project:

| Improvement | Root Cause | How to Implement | Owner | Target Date |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Better estimation | Estimates were 30% low | Add buffer to estimates, track actuals | Project Manager | Next project |
| More frequent syncs | Blockers weren't surface quickly | Daily 15-min standups | Team Lead | Next project |
| Clearer requirements | Scope expanded mid-project | Requirements review gate before planning | Product Manager | Next project |

### 6. Archive Project Artifacts

1. Mark [Epic] status as "Completed"
2. Mark all [Story] status as "Done" (if not already)
3. Mark [Retrospective] status as "Complete"
4. Keep all artifacts accessible (don't delete)
5. Consider organizing for easy lookup later (this project was good reference)

### 7. Distribute and Close

1. Share [Retrospective] with team and stakeholders
2. Discuss process improvements and next steps
3. Thank the team for their work
4. Mark project as officially closed

## Validation Checklist (CRITICAL - Complete before closing)

**The following MUST be true to officially close the project:**

- [ ] All [Task] are marked as "Done"
- [ ] All [Story] are marked as "Done"
- [ ] [Epic] status is marked as "Completed"
- [ ] [Retrospective] artifact has been created and documented
- [ ] All unresolved [Decision] artifacts are linked to [Retrospective]
- [ ] Lessons learned are documented comprehensively
- [ ] Process improvements are specific and actionable
- [ ] Follow-up action items are assigned with target dates
- [ ] [Retrospective] has been shared with team and stakeholders
- [ ] All [Project Artifacts] are organized and accessible for future reference

**If any item is not checked, project is NOT officially closed.**

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ **Skipping retrospective** → Team repeats same mistakes next project
- ❌ **Ignoring unresolved decisions** → They become problems later
- ❌ **Only celebrating successes** → Miss opportunities to improve
- ❌ **Being defensive** → Team won't give honest feedback
- ❌ **Making general improvement statements** → Nothing actually changes next time
  - "Better communication" (vague) vs. "15-minute daily standups at 9am" (specific)
- ❌ **Not documenting process improvements** → Knowledge is lost
- ❌ **Forgetting to thank team** → Morale suffers
- ❌ **Deleting project artifacts** → Can't reference later

## Tips for Success

- ✅ Make retrospective safe and judgment-free (people more honest)
- ✅ Be specific about improvements ("Add daily standups" vs. "Better communication")
- ✅ Ask "why?" to get to root causes
- ✅ Assign ownership to process improvements (someone accountable for change)
- ✅ Set target dates for improvements (make them real)
- ✅ Keep project artifacts organized (good reference for future projects)
- ✅ Share learnings widely (other teams benefit from your experience)
- ✅ Consider celebrating project completion (team morale)
- ✅ Track whether process improvements actually happen next project

## What Happens to Unresolved Decisions?

Some decisions stay "Unresolved" because:
- Not enough information yet
- Multiple valid options (no clear winner)
- Decision deferred to next project
- Decision depends on external factors

These should:
1. Be documented in [Retrospective] with explanation
2. Link to [Retrospective] clearly
3. Have a clear "revisit date" or "revisit trigger"
4. Be communicated to stakeholders

Example: "Security architecture decision deferred pending vendor quote - revisit when we have pricing."

## Celebrating Success

Don't skip this:
- Acknowledge team contributions
- Celebrate wins (features shipped, challenges overcome, timelines met)
- Share successes with broader organization
- Build team morale for next project

Projects are hard. People should feel good about completing one.

## End

Project is now officially closed. All artifacts are documented and accessible for future reference.
