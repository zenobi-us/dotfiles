## What are [Planning Artifact] Types?

- [Requirements]: High-level statements of what the product should achieve. They capture the needs and expectations of stakeholders.
- [Epic]: A large body of work that is described by Stories. An [Epic] is always accompanied by a [Spec], they have a 1:1 relationship.
- [Spec]: A detailed description of the project's requirements and objectives. It leads to creation of one or more [Story].
- [Research]: Information gathering and analysis conducted to inform project decisions. [Research] can lead to or adjust creation of [Spec] and/or [Decision]. Created ad-hoc when questions need investigation; linked to relevant [Spec], [Decision], [Story], or [Task].
- [Decision]: A conclusion reached after evaluating options, often based on [Research]. [Decision] can influence [Spec] and project direction. Created during Initiation/Planning (for strategic decisions) or during Execution (for implementation decisions). Status must be "Decided" or "Unresolved". All [Decision] artifacts with status "Unresolved" MUST be linked to the [Retrospective] during the Closing phase.
- [Story]: A smaller, manageable piece of work derived from an [Epic]. [Story] always contain "user stories". [Story] are always implemented by [Task].
- [Task]: A specific piece of work that needs to be completed as part of a [Story]. They are always linked to both a [Story] and an [Epic]. They can also be linked to other [Task] in interesting ways (e.g., blocking, dependent on, related to).

## [Planning Artifact] Require a ProjectId [CRITICAL]

Every [Planning Artifact] must be associated with a [ProjectId] to ensure proper organization and retrieval.

We use this [ProjectId] before interacting with any [Planning Artifact]. (Or if required, on every interaction)

### ProjectId Naming and Format

**ProjectId Convention:**

- Format: `slugified-project-name` (kebab-case, lowercase alphanumeric + hyphens)
- Source: Derived from git repository name or project name
- Generated by: `./scripts/get_project_id.sh` (automatically slugifies)
- Examples:
  - Repository: `github.com/username/dotfiles` → ProjectId: `dotfiles`
  - Project name: "User Authentication System" → ProjectId: `user-authentication-system`
  - Example name "My App v2" → ProjectId: `my-app-v2`

## How do we write [Planning Artifact]?

> [!NOTE]
> Wether creating a new [Planning Artifact] or updating an existing one, consistency is key.

This skill has access to templates for each artifact type.

- [Epic]: ./references/templates/epic_template.md
- [Spec]: ./references/templates/spec_template.md
- [Research]: ./references/templates/research_template.md
- [Decision]: ./references/templates/decision_template.md
- [Story]: ./references/templates/story_template.md
- [Task]: ./references/templates/task_template.md
- [Retrospective]: ./references/templates/retrospective_template.md

When creating or updating [Planning Artifact], use the corresponding template to ensure consistency.

## Artifact Storage Structure (Johnny Decimal System)

### Naming Convention

All artifacts follow the Johnny Decimal naming system for consistent organization and human readability:

```
{epicid}.{typecode}.{incrementid}-{typename}-{title}.md
```

**Components:**

- **{epicid}** - Epic identifier (0001, 0002, 0003, ...) - zero-padded
  - Identifies which epic the artifact belongs to
  - ALL artifacts except Retrospective must have an epic

- **{typecode}** - Artifact type code (fixed)
  - `1` = Spec
  - `2` = Research
  - `3` = Decision
  - `4` = Story
  - `5` = Task
  - `9` = Retrospective (project-level only, epic id is 0000)

- **{incrementid}** - Increment counter (0001, 0002, 0003, ...) - zero-padded
  - Increments per epic+type combination
  - Spec: Always 0001 per epic (one spec per epic)
  - Research: 0001, 0002, 0003... per epic
  - Decision: 0001, 0002, 0003... per epic
  - Story: 0001, 0002, 0003... per epic
  - Task: 0001, 0002, 0003... per epic

- **{typename}** - Human-readable type (spec, research, decision, story, task, retrospective)

- **{title}** - Human-readable title in kebab-case (e.g., user-authentication-requirements)

### Examples

| Artifact        | Filename                                        | Meaning                      |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Epic 1 Spec     | `0001.1.0001-spec-user-auth-requirements.md`    | Epic 1, Spec, 1st (only)     |
| Epic 1 Research | `0001.2.0001-research-oauth-alternatives.md`    | Epic 1, Research, 1st        |
| Epic 1 Research | `0001.2.0002-research-jwt-best-practices.md`    | Epic 1, Research, 2nd        |
| Epic 1 Decision | `0001.3.0001-decision-jwt-vs-session.md`        | Epic 1, Decision, 1st        |
| Epic 1 Story    | `0001.4.0001-story-user-login-flow.md`          | Epic 1, Story, 1st           |
| Epic 1 Task     | `0001.5.0001-task-database-schema-design.md`    | Epic 1, Task, 1st            |
| Epic 2 Spec     | `0002.1.0001-spec-api-security.md`              | Epic 2, Spec, 1st (only)     |
| Retrospective   | `0000.9.0001-retrospective-project-closeout.md` | Project-level, Retrospective |

### Folder Structure

Projects follow a hierarchy that groups artifacts by epic and type:

```
{ProjectId}/
│
├── {epicid}-{epic-name}/                    # Epic folder (groups related artifacts)
│   ├── {epicid}.1.0001-spec-{title}.md      # Spec file (only one per epic)
│   ├── {epicid}.2.0001-research-{title}.md  # Research files (multiple)
│   ├── {epicid}.2.0002-research-{title}.md
│   ├── {epicid}.3.0001-decision-{title}.md  # Decision files (multiple)
│   ├── {epicid}.3.0002-decision-{title}.md
│   ├── {epicid}.4.0001-story-{title}.md     # Story files (multiple)
│   └── {epicid}.4.0002-story-{title}.md
│
├── {epicid}.5.0001-task-{title}.md          # Task files at project level
├── {epicid}.5.0002-task-{title}.md
├── {epicid}.5.0003-task-{title}.md
│
└── 0000.9.0001-retrospective-{title}.md     # Project-level retrospective
```

**Why this structure:**

- ✅ **Visual hierarchy by path:** Human immediately sees which epic, which type, which order
- ✅ **Type visible in filename:** No ambiguity - `0001.3.0001` is clearly a decision
- ✅ **Johnny Decimal standard:** Familiar numbering system, naturally sorts in order
- ✅ **Epic folders group work:** All specs, research, decisions, stories for an epic in one folder
- ✅ **Tasks at project level:** Not nested, but epic/story IDs in filename show relationships
- ✅ **Human readable:** Title at end explains purpose at a glance
- ✅ **Operational oversight:** Manager opens folder, immediately sees all work organized

### Real Example: User Authentication System

```
user-auth-system/
│
├── 0001-user-authentication/
│   ├── 0001.1.0001-spec-user-authentication-requirements.md
│   ├── 0001.2.0001-research-oauth-alternatives.md
│   ├── 0001.2.0002-research-jwt-best-practices.md

```

**⚠️ FAILURE MODE:** Notice that ALL tasks (0001.5._, 0002.5._) are stored INSIDE their epic folders, NOT at the project level. Tasks at the project root level with no epic folder are an ERROR - they indicate orphaned work with unclear ownership and dependencies.

### Important Constraint: All Artifacts Belong to an Epic

Every artifact MUST be associated with an epic (except Retrospective):

- ✅ **Spec:** Always 1 per epic (0001.1.0001, 0002.1.0001, etc.)
- ✅ **Research:** Multiple per epic (0001.2.0001, 0001.2.0002, etc.)
- ✅ **Decision:** Multiple per epic (0001.3.0001, 0001.3.0002, etc.)
- ✅ **Story:** Multiple per epic (0001.4.0001, 0001.4.0002, etc.)
- ✅ **Task:** Multiple per epic (0001.5.0001, 0001.5.0002, etc.)
- ✅ **Retrospective:** Project-level, not tied to specific epic (0000.9.0001)

This ensures no orphaned artifacts and clear lineage from epic down to task.

### Obsidian Linking

All artifacts use Obsidian wiki-style linking for navigation and relationship management:

```markdown
[[{epicid}-{epic-name}]] # Link to epic folder
[[{epicid}.{typecode}.{incrementid}-{typename}-{title}]] # Link to artifact
```

**Important:** Link targets MUST match the actual filename exactly (without `.md` extension).

Examples:

- `[[0001-user-authentication]]` - Links to Epic 1 folder
- `[[0001.1.0001-spec-user-authentication-requirements]]` - Links to specific spec
- `[[0001.5.0001-task-design-database-schema]]` - Links to specific task

**Frontmatter Links:** All artifact templates use `target:` field (not `itemId:`) to specify link targets that match filenames. When creating artifacts, replace placeholder filenames with actual titles following the naming convention.

Example frontmatter:

```yaml
links:
  - type: epic
    target: 0001-user-authentication
  - type: spec
    target: 0001.1.0001-spec-user-auth-requirements
  - type: task
    target: 0001.5.0001-task-schema-design
```

See individual artifact templates for linking examples in frontmatter and body.

## Effort Estimation Hierarchy

[Epic], [Story], and [Task] have different estimation levels:

### [Epic] Estimation

- Estimated in **weeks or months** (high-level)
- Derived from Story points of child [Story] (sum all stories)
- Used for: Timeline planning, resource allocation
- Refinement: As [Story] are created and estimated

### [Story] Estimation

- Estimated in **story points** (3-13 points typical range)
- Based on: Complexity, risk, dependencies
- Used for: Release planning, sprint capacity
- Refinement: During Planning phase before creating [Task]

### [Task] Estimation

- Estimated in **story points** (1-8 points)
- Based on: Specific implementation work, clear acceptance criteria
- Constraint: If [Task] > 8 points, it should be split into smaller [Task]
- Used for: Day-to-day execution, capacity planning, identifying blockers
- Refinement: Continuous during Execution as understanding grows

**Why this hierarchy matters:**

- Epic scale helps executives understand project timeline
- Story scale helps team understand sprint commitment
- Task scale helps individual contributors understand daily work
- Misalignment = surprises (story was "5 points" but contained "3x13 point tasks")

## How are [Task] relationships described?

[Task] can be linked to other [Task] in interesting ways. Choose the relationship type that best describes the interaction:

### Task Relationship Types

**When to use "blocking":**

- THIS Task must finish BEFORE other Task can start
- Use: Document dependencies for critical path analysis
- Example: "Database schema design blocks API implementation"
- From Task perspective: "This task blocks: api-task-001"

**When to use "dependent_on":**

- THIS Task cannot start UNTIL another Task finishes
- Use: Identify what's blocking your progress
- Example: "API implementation depends on database schema design"
- From Task perspective: "This task is dependent_on: database-task-001"
- Note: "blocking" and "dependent_on" are the same relationship viewed from opposite directions

**When to use "related_to":**

- THIS Task is connected but does NOT have direct dependency
- Use: Track work in same area (e.g., similar components, same feature)
- Example: "Frontend auth task is related to backend auth task" (parallel, not blocking)
- Use sparingly - don't link everything

**When to use "duplicate_of":**

- THIS Task is a duplicate of another [Task]
- Use: When duplicate work is discovered, mark the duplicate and consolidate
- Example: "This task is duplicate_of: auth-task-002"
- Action: Cancel this task, redirect work to the original

**Linking to [Research] or [Decision]:**

- "influenced_by_research": This task was shaped by investigation/analysis
- "influenced_by_decision": This task was created based on a decision made
- Use: For traceability and understanding "why was this built this way?"

**Parent artifact links (MANDATORY):**

- Every [Task] MUST link to: parent [Story] AND parent [Epic]
- This establishes the hierarchy and enables queries like "all tasks in this epic"

## Artifact Status Transitions

Each artifact type has valid status progressions that guide state management throughout the project lifecycle.

→ **See: `references/status-flow.md`** for detailed status flow diagrams and descriptions for all artifact types (Epic, Spec, Story, Task, Decision, Research, Retrospective).

## Artifact Schemas and Content Structure

All artifacts follow consistent schema patterns for organization and linking. Each artifact type has specific frontmatter requirements and content sections.

→ **See: `references/schema.md`** for detailed task relationship schema, artifact content structure, and link type definitions for all artifact types (Epic, Spec, Story, Task).
