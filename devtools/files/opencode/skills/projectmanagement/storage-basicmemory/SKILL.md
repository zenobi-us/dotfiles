description: Use when storing project artifacts in basic memory storage.
---

**Core principle:** All project artifacts must be stored in basicmemory under a [ProjectId], with explicit linking and status tracking to maintain single source of truth across concurrent projects.

> [!NOTE]
> Before starting anything, ensure you have identified the correct [ProjectId] for the project you are working on.

## Requirements:

- use basicmemory mcp tools to read and write [Project Artifacts].
- Recognise types of [Project Artifacts]: [Spec], [Research], [Descision], [Epic], [Story], [Task], [Retrospective].
- Store [Project Artifacts] in basicmemory under the correct project context using [ProjectId].

## How to interact with [Project Artifacts] storage?

**CRITICAL** All [Project Artifacts] are interacted with via basicmemory mcp tools.
**FAILURE MODE** Interacting with [Project Artifacts] via the file system directly is not allowed and will lead to disorganization and loss of data.

### [ProjectId] Naming and Format

**ProjectId Convention:**

- Format: `slugified-project-name` (kebab-case, lowercase alphanumeric + hyphens)
- Source: Derived from git repository name or project name
- Generated by: `./scripts/get_project_id.sh` (automatically slugifies)
- Examples:
  - Repository: `github.com/username/dotfiles` → ProjectId: `dotfiles`
  - Project name: "User Authentication System" → ProjectId: `user-authentication-system`
  - Example name "My App v2" → ProjectId: `my-app-v2`

### Creating new Projects

If you need to create a new project in basicmemory, always ensure that 

- Follow the [ProjectId] naming convention.
- Confirm the project does not already exist by listing existing projects first.
- Store the project at ~/Notes/Projects/[ProjectId]
- Never store the project in the same folder as the repo you are working on.
