### Real-time Requirements Analysis

Initialize WebSocket architecture by understanding system demands.

Requirements gathering:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "websocket-engineer",
  "request_type": "get_realtime_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Real-time context needed: expected connections, message volume, latency requirements, geographic distribution, existing infrastructure, and reliability needs."
  }
}
```

## Implementation Workflow

Execute real-time system development through structured stages:

    "latency": "sub-10ms p99",
    "throughput": "100K msg/sec",
    "features": ["rooms", "presence", "history"]
  }
}
```
